Palmolive Building	<p>The <b>Palmolive Building</b>, formerly the <b>Playboy Building</b>, is a 37-story Art Deco building at 919 N. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Built by Holabird &amp; Root, it was completed in 1929 and was home to the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Corporation. </p><p>The Palmolive Building was renamed the <b>Playboy Building</b> in 1965 when Playboy Enterprises purchased the leasehold of the building. It was home to the editorial and business offices of <i>Playboy</i> magazine from that time until 1989 when Playboy moved its offices to 680 N Lake Shore Drive. Playboy had sold the leasehold in 1980 and signed a 10-year lease that expired in 1990. The new leaseholder renamed the building 919 North Michigan Avenue.</p><p>During the time that Playboy was in the building, the word P-L-A-Y-B-O-Y was spelled out in 9-foot (2.7 m) illuminated letters on the north and south roofline. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2000, and it was added to the federal National Register of Historic Places in 2003. </p><p>In 2001, the building was sold to developer Draper and Kramer who, with Booth Hansen Architects, converted it to residential use with the first two floors dedicated to upscale office and retail space. High-end condos make up the rest of the building. The new owners restored the building's name to the Palmolive Building. The business address remains 919 North Michigan Avenue; however, the residential address is 159 East Walton Place. Notable residents of the building include Vince Vaughn, who bought a 12,000-square-foot triplex penthouse encompassing the 35th, 36th and 37th floors for $12 million. In February 2013, Vaughn offered the penthouse for sale as a pocket listing for $24.9 million. However, after multiple price cuts he chose in May 2016 to divide the unit in two, offering one for $8.5 million, and the other smaller unit for $4.2 million.</p>	the palmolive building formerly the playboy building is a 37story art deco building at 919 n michigan avenue in chicago built by holabird amp root it was completed in 1929 and was home to the colgatepalmolivepeet corporation the palmolive building was renamed the playboy building in 1965 when playboy enterprises purchased the leasehold of the building it was home to the editorial and business offices of playboy magazine from that time until 1989 when playboy moved its offices to 680 n lake shore drive playboy had sold the leasehold in 1980 and signed a 10year lease that expired in 1990 the new leaseholder renamed the building 919 north michigan avenueduring the time that playboy was in the building the word playboy was spelled out in 9foot 27 m illuminated letters on the north and south roofline the building was designated a chicago landmark in 2000 and it was added to the federal national register of historic places in 2003 in 2001 the building was sold to developer draper and kramer who with booth hansen architects converted it to residential use with the first two floors dedicated to upscale office and retail space highend condos make up the rest of the building the new owners restored the buildings name to the palmolive building the business address remains 919 north michigan avenue however the residential address is 159 east walton place notable residents of the building include vince vaughn who bought a 12000squarefoot triplex penthouse encompassing the 35th 36th and 37th floors for 12 million in february 2013 vaughn offered the penthouse for sale as a pocket listing for 249 million however after multiple price cuts he chose in may 2016 to divide the unit in two offering one for 85 million and the other smaller unit for 42 million	building in Chicago	building in chicago	Written_communication

The Book (short story)	"<p>""<b>The Book</b>"" is an unfinished short story by American horror fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft, believed to have been written in late 1933.

My Immortal (fan fiction)	"<p><i><b>My Immortal</b></i> is a <i>Harry Potter</i>-based fan fiction serially published on FanFiction.net between 2006 and 2007. Though notable for its convoluted narrative and constant digressions, the story largely centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named ""Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way"" and her relationships with the characters of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, particularly her romantic relationship with Draco Malfoy, culminating in her traveling back in time to defeat the main antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort (or 'Vlodemort'). </p><p><i>My Immortal</i> is popularly regarded as one of the worst works of fan fiction ever written. Since the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its constant grammar and spelling errors, plot inconsistencies and complete disregard for the original <i>Harry Potter</i> source material. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a YouTube web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life. </p><p>The author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as ""unsolvable"". The author published the story under the username ""XXXbloodyrists666XXX"" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a FictionPress account stating that she had created an active Tumblr account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of young adult novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of <i>My Immortal</i> and had provided evidence of her authorship to Macmillan Publishers, but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship. </p><p>The story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to fool and troll readers or to satirize fan fiction, but others consider the work and the alleged online presence of the author too elaborate to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that <i>My Immortal</i> is a work of satire, though her authorship is disputed. </p> "	my immortal is a harry potterbased fan fiction serially published on fanfictionnet between 2006 and 2007 though notable for its convoluted narrative and constant digressions the story largely centers on a noncanonical female vampire character named ebony darkness dementia raven way and her relationships with the characters of the harry potter series particularly her romantic relationship with draco malfoy culminating in her traveling back in time to defeat the main antagonist of the series lord voldemort or vlodemort my immortal is popularly regarded as one of the worst works of fan fiction ever written since the works publication it has gained infamy for its constant grammar and spelling errors plot inconsistencies and complete disregard for the original harry potter source material despite this the series has also inspired multiple derivative works including a youtube web series and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life the authors identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as unsolvable the author published the story under the username xxxbloodyrists666xxx and selfidentified as tara gilesbie in september 2017 someone claiming to be the author updated a fictionpress account stating that she had created an active tumblr account under her real name an effort to locate this tumblr account resulted in the account of young adult novelist rose christo she has since stated that she was one of two coauthors of my immortal and had provided evidence of her authorship to macmillan publishers but controversy that same month over factual errors in her thenforthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship the story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to fool and troll readers or to satirize fan fiction but others consider the work and the alleged online presence of the author too elaborate to fake effectively in september 2017 christo stated that my immortal is a work of satire though her authorship is disputed	work of fan fiction that inspired various derivative works	work of fan fiction that inspired various derivative works	Written_communication
On Social Freedom	"<p><b>On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life</b> is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, but later found to have been falsely attributed to him.</p><p>Discovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which Mill died in Avignon, France, it was published in June 1907 as a special article in The Oxford and Cambridge Review. The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing <i>On Liberty</i>, but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work <i>Mill and His Early Critics</i>. </p><p>Rees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:</p> <blockquote><p>In September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled ""Social Freedom."" Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of ""promise rather than performance"" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not ""to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence."" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he ""should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.""</p></blockquote> <p>The letter is included in Mill's <i>Collected Works</i> where Edger is identified as ""probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of G.J. Holyoake in the promoting of the co-operative movement, writer for <i>The Secular World</i> and author of tracts on co-operation."" Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in <i>The History of Co-operation</i>:</p> <blockquote><p>""Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be ""manly, open, and ingenious appearance,"" beyond what he expected of one belonging to the ""depressed"" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:- </p><blockquote><p>""I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell'). I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm. There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only <i>bounty</i> of the squire towards poor neighbours. </p><p>(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish. (2) Each member can hold only one share. (3) Members have no voice in the management. (4) Wages to workmen same as usual. (5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders. The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant. It has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way. Remember, I only give my impressions."" </p> </blockquote></blockquote> <p>An E.R. Edger is also listed in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 24 April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.</p>"	on social freedom or the necessary limits of individual freedom arising out of the conditions of our social life is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the british philosopher john stuart mill but later found to have been falsely attributed to himdiscovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which mill died in avignon france it was published in june 1907 as a special article in the oxford and cambridge review the work was republished by columbia university press in 1941 but failed to attract much attention in 1955 the liberal arts press intended to republish it in a volume also containing on liberty but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the mill scholar jc rees he then set out the full case against attributing the work to mill in his 1956 work mill and his early critics reess explanation for how the manuscript ended up among mills possessions is summarised by jp scanlan in september 1862 mill wrote a letter from avignon to a certain er edger acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled social freedom apparently edger hoped to elicit from mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work mostly however in the form of promise rather than performance and he exhorts edger to continue thinking and writing though not to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence concerining edgers views mill says only that if he were to comment in detail he should have much to say against several of your positions and especially against your definition of liberty the letter is included in mills collected works where edger is identified as probably ebenezer r edger associate of gj holyoake in the promoting of the cooperative movement writer for the secular world and author of tracts on cooperation holyoake briefly mentions edger in the history of cooperation ten years later my colleague mr e r edger visited mr crisell the manager of the farm whom the rev mr robinson had found to be manly open and ingenious appearance beyond what he expected of one belonging to the depressed class mr edger sent me this report i paid a visit to assington and had a conversation with the manager mr crisell pronounced with i long crysell i can feel no enthusiasm at all about the assington farm there seems no cooperation in the right sense of the term but only bounty of the squire towards poor neighbours 1 it is limited to inhabitants of the parish 2 each member can hold only one share 3 members have no voice in the management 4 wages to workmen same as usual 5 no special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders the manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members this seems to me very significant it has been in existence fortyone years so it will take a long time to renovate society that way remember i only give my impressions an er edger is also listed in the british medical journal on 24 april 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the royal college of surgeons of england	book by John Stuart Mill	book by john stuart mill	Written_communication

As a child, she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in Kandahar, Afghan. Her work is considered to challenge traditional Muslim culture like the burqa. According to Suliman, ""The burqa is a way of controlling, but in the name of respect. Every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa. It is honor, culture, and religion. Really, it just controls the woman and keeps her inside."" Malina's work has gained the attention of the Taliban and traditional Muslims, resulting in having received threats from the Taliban towards Suliman and her family. The artist was subject to physical threats, rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her work.</p><p>Not only does Malina worry about the Taliban, but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art. Writing art that that displays the human body like Malina's motif, the skeleton in a burqa, is seen as idol worship. To the Taliban and other traditional Muslims, Malina's artwork is un-Islamic and Suliman's parents were embarrassed. Because of this her parents went the distance and locked Malina in their house for nearly a year, which had the opposite effect they were hoping for. Malina claimed that, “Today, whatever I am doing for art, it’s all because of that one year in which I was staying in a home.” Suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world. In December 2019, Malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in Rome but it was cancelled. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1423 Cached time: 20220514215637 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.225 seconds Real time usage: 0.287 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1675/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 10806/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1002/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 0/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 8283/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.124/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3517711/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 268.254 1 -total 65.21% 174.915 1 Template:Infobox_artist 61.96% 166.205 1 Template:Infobox_person 48.80% 130.912 1 Template:Infobox 29.29% 78.576 2 Template:Cite_web 20.80% 55.799 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 15.01% 40.272 1 Template:Birth_year_and_age 7.44% 19.969 16 Template:Main_other 5.29% 14.183 9 Template:Pluralize_from_text 3.06% 8.220 2 Template:Cite_news -->"	malina suliman a graffiti artist metalworker and painter was born in kabul afghanistan in 1990 as a child she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in kandahar afghan her work is considered to challenge traditional muslim culture like the burqa according to suliman the burqa is a way of controlling but in the name of respect every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa it is honor culture and religion really it just controls the woman and keeps her inside malinas work has gained the attention of the taliban and traditional muslims resulting in having received threats from the taliban towards suliman and her family the artist was subject to physical threats rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her worknot only does malina worry about the taliban but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art writing art that that displays the human body like malinas motif the skeleton in a burqa is seen as idol worship to the taliban and other traditional muslims malinas artwork is unislamic and sulimans parents were embarrassed because of this her parents went the distance and locked malina in their house for nearly a year which had the opposite effect they were hoping for malina claimed that “ today whatever i am doing for art it ’ s all because of that one year in which i was staying in a home ” suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world in december 2019 malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in rome but it was cancelled	Afghan artist	afghan artist	Written_communication

Genius (literature)	"<p>The concept of <b>genius,</b> in literary theory and literary history, derives from the later 18th century, when it began to be distinguished from <i>ingenium</i> in a discussion of the <i>genius loci,</i> or ""spirit of the place."" It was a way of discussing essence, in that each place was supposed to have its own unique and immutable nature, but this essence was determinant, in that all persons of a place would be infused or inspired by that nature. In the early nationalistic literary theories of the Augustan era, each nation was supposed to have a nature determined by its climate, air, and fauna that made a nation's poetry, manners, and art singular. It created national character. </p><p>T.V.F. Brogan argues that ""genius"" is a middle term in the evolution of the idea of inspiration and poetic ability from a belief in an external source (<i>afflatus,</i> or divine infection, and poetic phrenzy, or divine madness) and an internal source (imagination and the subconscious). However, the concept became nearly identical with poetic madness and divine madness in later Romanticism. The word itself was conflated with the Latin <i>ingenium</i> (natural ability) by the time of the Renaissance, and it thereby becomes a natural spirit or natural essence unique to the individual and yet derived from the place. In this sense, it is still a term synonymous with skill. </p>"	the concept of genius in literary theory and literary history derives from the later 18th century when it began to be distinguished from ingenium in a discussion of the genius loci or spirit of the place it was a way of discussing essence in that each place was supposed to have its own unique and immutable nature but this essence was determinant in that all persons of a place would be infused or inspired by that nature in the early nationalistic literary theories of the augustan era each nation was supposed to have a nature determined by its climate air and fauna that made a nations poetry manners and art singular it created national character tvf brogan argues that genius is a middle term in the evolution of the idea of inspiration and poetic ability from a belief in an external source afflatus or divine infection and poetic phrenzy or divine madness and an internal source imagination and the subconscious however the concept became nearly identical with poetic madness and divine madness in later romanticism the word itself was conflated with the latin ingenium natural ability by the time of the renaissance and it thereby becomes a natural spirit or natural essence unique to the individual and yet derived from the place in this sense it is still a term synonymous with skill	concept in literary theory and literary history	concept in literary theory and literary history	Written_communication

Focalisation	<p><b>Focalisation</b> is a term coined by the French narrative theorist Gérard Genette. It refers to the perspective through which a narrative is presented. Genette focuses on the interplay between three forms of <i>focalization</i> and the distinction between <i>heterodiegetic</i> and <i>homodiegetic</i> narrators. Homodiegetic narrators exist in the same (hence the prefix 'homo') storyworld as the characters exist in, whereas heterodiegetic narrators are not a part of that storyworld. The term 'focalization' refers to how information is restricted in storytelling. Genette distinguishes between <i>internal</i> focalization, <i>external</i> focalization, and <i>zero</i> focalization. Internal focalization means that the narrative focuses on thoughts and emotions while external focalization focuses solely on characters' actions, behavior, the setting etc. Zero focalization is seen when the narrator is omniscient in the sense that it is not restricted. </p> 	focalisation is a term coined by the french narrative theorist gérard genette it refers to the perspective through which a narrative is presented genette focuses on the interplay between three forms of focalization and the distinction between heterodiegetic and homodiegetic narrators homodiegetic narrators exist in the same hence the prefix homo storyworld as the characters exist in whereas heterodiegetic narrators are not a part of that storyworld the term focalization refers to how information is restricted in storytelling genette distinguishes between internal focalization external focalization and zero focalization internal focalization means that the narrative focuses on thoughts and emotions while external focalization focuses solely on characters actions behavior the setting etc zero focalization is seen when the narrator is omniscient in the sense that it is not restricted	perspective through which a narrative is presented	perspective through which a narrative is presented	Written_communication

Perpessicius	"<p><b>Perpessicius</b> (<small>Romanian: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[perpeˈsit͡ʃjus]</span>; pen name of <b>Dumitru S. Panaitescu</b>, also known as <b>Panait Șt. Dumitru</b>, <b>D. P. Perpessicius</b> and <b>Panaitescu-Perpessicius</b>; October 22, 1891 – March 29, 1971) was a Romanian literary historian and critic, poet, essayist and fiction writer. One of the prominent literary chroniclers of the Romanian interwar, he stood apart in his generation for having thrown his support behind the modernist and avant-garde currents of Romanian literature. As a theorist, Perpessicius merged the tenets of Symbolism with the pragmatic conservative principles of the 19th century <i>Junimea</i> society, but was much-criticized over perceptions that, in the name of aesthetic relativism, he tolerated literary failure. Also known as an anthologist, biographer, museologist, folklorist and book publisher, he was, together with George Călinescu, one of his generation's best-known researchers to have focused on the work of <i>Junimist</i> author and since-acknowledged national poet Mihai Eminescu. Much of Perpessicius' career was dedicated to collecting, structuring and interpreting Eminescu's texts, resulting in an authoritative edition of Eminescu's writings, the 17-volume <i>Opere</i> (""Works""). </p><p>A veteran of World War I, where he lost use of his right arm, Perpessicius debuted in poetry while recovering in hospital, publishing the critically acclaimed volume <i>Scut și targă</i> (""Shield and Stretcher""). His subsequent ""intimist"" and Neoclassical tendencies made him part of a distinct current within the local branch of Symbolism. Like other mainstream modernists of his day, Perpessicius also espoused anti-fascism and criticized nationalism in general, attitudes which led him into conflict with the 1930s far right. In 1938-1940 however, Perpessicius controversially offered a degree of support to the fascist-inspired National Renaissance Front, and was promoted by its leader, King Carol II. Sympathetic to the left-wing trend after World War II, Perpessicius was drawn into cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party. Although subsequently endorsed and acclaimed by the communist regime, Perpessicius was reluctant to condone its policies and dedicated his final years almost exclusively to literature. A member of the Romanian Academy and founding director of the Museum of Romanian Literature, he was co-editor of <i>Viața Românească</i> magazine, and, in 1957, head of the Academy's Library. </p>"	perpessicius romanian perpeˈsit͡ʃjus pen name of dumitru s panaitescu also known as panait șt dumitru d p perpessicius and panaitescuperpessicius october 22 1891 – march 29 1971 was a romanian literary historian and critic poet essayist and fiction writer one of the prominent literary chroniclers of the romanian interwar he stood apart in his generation for having thrown his support behind the modernist and avantgarde currents of romanian literature as a theorist perpessicius merged the tenets of symbolism with the pragmatic conservative principles of the 19th century junimea society but was muchcriticized over perceptions that in the name of aesthetic relativism he tolerated literary failure also known as an anthologist biographer museologist folklorist and book publisher he was together with george călinescu one of his generations bestknown researchers to have focused on the work of junimist author and sinceacknowledged national poet mihai eminescu much of perpessicius career was dedicated to collecting structuring and interpreting eminescus texts resulting in an authoritative edition of eminescus writings the 17volume opere works a veteran of world war i where he lost use of his right arm perpessicius debuted in poetry while recovering in hospital publishing the critically acclaimed volume scut și targă shield and stretcher his subsequent intimist and neoclassical tendencies made him part of a distinct current within the local branch of symbolism like other mainstream modernists of his day perpessicius also espoused antifascism and criticized nationalism in general attitudes which led him into conflict with the 1930s far right in 19381940 however perpessicius controversially offered a degree of support to the fascistinspired national renaissance front and was promoted by its leader king carol ii sympathetic to the leftwing trend after world war ii perpessicius was drawn into cooperation with the romanian communist party although subsequently endorsed and acclaimed by the communist regime perpessicius was reluctant to condone its policies and dedicated his final years almost exclusively to literature a member of the romanian academy and founding director of the museum of romanian literature he was coeditor of viața românească magazine and in 1957 head of the academys library	Romanian writer	romanian writer	Written_communication

A representative of Ancient Greek literature of the Hellenistic period, he wrote over 800 literary works in a wide variety of genres, most of which did not survive. He espoused an aesthetic philosophy, known as Callimacheanism, which exerted a strong influence on the poets of the Roman Empire and, through them, on all subsequent Western literature. </p><p>Born into a prominent family in the Greek city of Cyrene in modern-day Libya, he was educated in Alexandria, the capital of the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt. After working as a schoolteacher in the city, he came under the patronage of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus and was employed at the Library of Alexandria where he compiled the <i>Pinakes</i>, a comprehensive catalogue of all Greek literature. He is believed to have lived into the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes. </p><p>Although Callimachus wrote prolifically in prose and poetry, only a small number of his poetical texts have been preserved. His main works are the <i>Aetia</i>, a four-book aetiological poem, six religious hymns, around 60 epigrams, a collection of satirical iambs, and a narrative poem entitled <i>Hecale</i>. Callimachus shared many characteristics with his Alexandrian contemporaries Aratus, Apollonius of Rhodes and Theocritus, but professed to adhere to a unique style of poetry: favouring small, recondite and even obscure topics, he dedicated himself to small-scale poetry and refused to write longwinded epic poetry, the most prominent literary art of his day. </p><p>Callimachus and his aesthetic philosophy became an important point of reference for Roman poets of the late Republic and the early Empire. Catullus, Horace, Vergil, Propertius, and Ovid saw his poetry as one of their ""principal model[s]"" and engaged with it in a variety of ways. Modern classical scholars view him as one of the most influential Greek poets. According to the Hellenist Kathryn Gutzwiller, he ""reinvented Greek poetry for the Hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came, through its manifestations in Roman poetry, to influence the entire tradition of modern literature"".</p>"	callimachus ancient greek καλλίμαχος romanized kallimachos c 310 – c 240 bc was an ancient greek poet scholar and librarian who was active in alexandria during the 3rd century bc a representative of ancient greek literature of the hellenistic period he wrote over 800 literary works in a wide variety of genres most of which did not survive he espoused an aesthetic philosophy known as callimacheanism which exerted a strong influence on the poets of the roman empire and through them on all subsequent western literature born into a prominent family in the greek city of cyrene in modernday libya he was educated in alexandria the capital of the ptolemaic kings of egypt after working as a schoolteacher in the city he came under the patronage of king ptolemy ii philadelphus and was employed at the library of alexandria where he compiled the pinakes a comprehensive catalogue of all greek literature he is believed to have lived into the reign of ptolemy iii euergetes although callimachus wrote prolifically in prose and poetry only a small number of his poetical texts have been preserved his main works are the aetia a fourbook aetiological poem six religious hymns around 60 epigrams a collection of satirical iambs and a narrative poem entitled hecale callimachus shared many characteristics with his alexandrian contemporaries aratus apollonius of rhodes and theocritus but professed to adhere to a unique style of poetry favouring small recondite and even obscure topics he dedicated himself to smallscale poetry and refused to write longwinded epic poetry the most prominent literary art of his day callimachus and his aesthetic philosophy became an important point of reference for roman poets of the late republic and the early empire catullus horace vergil propertius and ovid saw his poetry as one of their principal models and engaged with it in a variety of ways modern classical scholars view him as one of the most influential greek poets according to the hellenist kathryn gutzwiller he reinvented greek poetry for the hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came through its manifestations in roman poetry to influence the entire tradition of modern literature	ancient poet and librarian	ancient poet and librarian	Written_communication

Epitome	"<p>An <b>epitome</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang=""el"">ἐπιτομή</span>, from ἐπιτέμνειν <i>epitemnein</i> meaning ""to cut short"") is a summary or miniature form, or an instance that represents a larger reality, also used as a synonym for embodiment. Epitomacy represents ""to the degree of."" An abridgment differs from an epitome in that an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed, as opposed to the epitome, which is an original summation of a work, at least in part. </p><p>Many documents from the Ancient Greek and Roman worlds survive now only ""in epitome,"" referring to the practice of some later authors (epitomators) who wrote distilled versions of larger works now lost. Some writers attempted to convey the stance and spirit of the original, while others added further details or anecdotes regarding the general subject. As with all secondary historical sources, a different bias not present in the original may creep in. </p><p>Documents surviving in epitome differ from those surviving only as fragments quoted in later works and those used as unacknowledged sources by later scholars, as they can stand as discrete documents but refracted through the views of another author. </p><p>Epitomes of a kind are still produced today when dealing with a corpus of literature, especially classical works often considered dense, unwieldy and unlikely to be read by the average person, to make them more accessible: some are more along the lines of abridgments, such as many which have been written of Edward Gibbon's <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, a work of eight large volumes (about 3600 pages) often published as one volume of about 1400 pages. Mini-epitomes is like an extension of matched templates but with smarter patches can be learnt by the EM algorithm: extending k‐means.

Vancouver system	"<p>The <b>Vancouver system</b>, also known as <b>Vancouver reference style</b> or the <b>author–number system</b>, is a citation style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the physical sciences and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the author–date, or ""Harvard"", system. Vancouver style is used by MEDLINE and PubMed.</p><p>Hundreds of scientific journals use author–number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as punctuation, casing of titles, and italic, vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names ""Vancouver system"" or ""Vancouver style"" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is <i>Citing Medicine</i>, per the <i>References &gt; Style and Format</i> section of the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals. These recommendations, the <i>Vancouver Convention</i> and <i>Vancouver guidelines</i>, have a much broader scope than only the citation style: they provide ethical guidelines for writers and rules for co-authorship in scientific collaborations to avoid fraud. The Convention further entails compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and research projects must be recommended by an independent ethics committee.</p><p>In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author–number system regardless of the formatting details. A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author–number format specified by the ICMJE Recommendations (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM). For example, the AMA reference style is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author–number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed). </p>"	the vancouver system also known as vancouver reference style or the author–number system is a citation style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list it is popular in the physical sciences and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine the other being the author–date or harvard system vancouver style is used by medline and pubmedhundreds of scientific journals use author–number systems they all follow the same essential logic that is numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries although the trivial details of the output mask such as punctuation casing of titles and italic vary widely among them they have existed for over a century the names vancouver system or vancouver style have existed since 1978 the latest version of the latter is citing medicine per the references gt style and format section of the icmje recommendations for the conduct reporting editing and publication of scholarly work in medical journals these recommendations the vancouver convention and vancouver guidelines have a much broader scope than only the citation style they provide ethical guidelines for writers and rules for coauthorship in scientific collaborations to avoid fraud the convention further entails compliance with the helsinki declaration and research projects must be recommended by an independent ethics committeein the broad sense the vancouver system refers to any author–number system regardless of the formatting details a narrower definition of the vancouver system refers to a specific author–number format specified by the icmje recommendations uniform requirements for manuscripts urm for example the ama reference style is vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author–number system that conforms to the urm but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the nlmpubmed style such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed	style of referencing	style of referencing	Written_communication
Bad quarto	"<p>A <b>bad quarto</b>, in Shakespearean scholarship, is a quarto-sized printed edition of one of Shakespeare's plays that is considered to be unauthorised, and is theorised to have been pirated from a theatrical performance without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or, alternatively, written down later from memory by an actor or group of actors in the cast – the latter process has been termed ""memorial reconstruction"". Since the quarto derives from a performance, hence lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to be ""bad"", i.e. to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.</p><p>In contrast, a ""good quarto"" is considered to be a text that is authorised and which may have been printed from the author's manuscript (or a working draft thereof, known as his <i>foul papers</i>), or from a scribal copy or prompt copy derived from the manuscript or <i>foul papers</i>.</p><p>The concept of the <i>bad quarto</i> originates in 1909, attributed to A W Pollard and W W Gregg. The theory defines as ""bad quartos"" the first quarto printings of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Henry V</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>, and seeks to explain why there are substantial textual differences between those quartos and the 1623 printing of the first folio edition of the plays. </p><p>The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and the collaborative script, <i>Sir Thomas More</i>.</p><p>The theory has been accepted, studied and expanded by many scholars; but some modern scholars are challenging it and those, such as Eric Sams, consider the entire theory to be without foundation.

False Folio	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>False Folio</b> is the term that Shakespeare scholars and bibliographers have applied to William Jaggard's printing of ten Shakespearean and pseudo-Shakespearean plays together in 1619, the first attempt to collect Shakespeare's work in a single volume. There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC. The other is held in the Special Collections at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p>The term ""false folio"" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the First Folio of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description ""folio"" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual quarto format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is <i>false</i> folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by Alfred W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his <i>Shakespeare Folios and Quartos</i>.</p><p>In summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice. Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: Stationers Company; Stationers' Register], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were: </p> <ul><li><i>Henry V</i> – ""printed for T. P. 1608"" on the title page. False date. Thomas Pavier was the stationer who possessed the rights to <i>Henry V</i>, and was an associate of Jaggard.</li> <li><i>King Lear</i> – ""Printed for Nathaniel Butter 1608."" False date and name. Nicholas Okes had printed Q1 of <i>Lear</i> for Butter in 1608.</li> <li><i>The Merchant of Venice</i> – ""Printed by J. Roberts, 1600."" False date and name. This was one play to which Jaggard did not have valid title; it belonged to stationer Laurence Hayes.</li> <li><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> – ""Printed for Arthur Johnson, 1619."" False date and name. Johnson published Q1 of <i>Merry Wives</i> in 1602.</li> <li><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> – ""Printed by James Roberts, 1600."" False date and name.</li> <li><i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i> – ""Printed for T. P. 1619"", date ""corrected"" to 1609 in second state.</li> <li><i>Sir John Oldcastle</i> – ""printed for T. P. 1600"". False date.</li> <li><i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i> – ""Printed for T. P. 1619.""</li> <li><i>The Whole Contention Between the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York</i> – ""Printed at London, for T. P."" This was the major innovation of the collection: Jaggard joined together two previously separate texts, <i>The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster</i> (the early version of <i>Henry VI, Part 2,</i> published by Thomas Millington in 1594 and 1600), and <i>The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York</i> (the early version of <i>Henry VI, Part 3,</i> published by Millington in 1595 and 1600). In 1602, Pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from Millington.</li></ul><p><i>Pericles</i> was printed after <i>The Whole Contention</i>, since their signatures (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.) </p><p>As Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, he may also have lacked rights to Butter's <i>Lear</i> and Johnson's <i>Merry Wives</i>. There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the King's Men used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the ""Pavier quartos"" instead of the ""False Folio.""</p><p>Pollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary ""piracy,"" and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.</p>"	false folio is the term that shakespeare scholars and bibliographers have applied to william jaggards printing of ten shakespearean and pseudoshakespearean plays together in 1619 the first attempt to collect shakespeares work in a single volume there are only two complete extant copies one is part of the collection of the folger shakespeare library in washington dc the other is held in the special collections at texas christian university in fort worth texas the term false folio intentionally evokes the folio collections of shakespeares works that appeared later the first folio of 1623 and its three seventeenthcentury successors the description folio is not strictly accurate since the ten plays were printed in a largerthanusual quarto format not in folio but the key qualifier is false folio the texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by alfred w pollard w w greg and william j neidig pollard provides a detailed account in his shakespeare folios and quartosin summary the stationer and printer william jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619 either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice jaggard however did not have clear title to all of the plays involved see stationers company stationers register and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos the ten plays were henry v – printed for t p 1608 on the title page false date thomas pavier was the stationer who possessed the rights to henry v and was an associate of jaggard king lear – printed for nathaniel butter 1608 false date and name nicholas okes had printed q1 of lear for butter in 1608 the merchant of venice – printed by j roberts 1600 false date and name this was one play to which jaggard did not have valid title it belonged to stationer laurence hayes the merry wives of windsor – printed for arthur johnson 1619 false date and name johnson published q1 of merry wives in 1602 a midsummer nights dream – printed by james roberts 1600 false date and name pericles prince of tyre – printed for t p 1619 date corrected to 1609 in second state sir john oldcastle – printed for t p 1600 false date a yorkshire tragedy – printed for t p 1619 the whole contention between the two famous houses lancaster and york – printed at london for t p this was the major innovation of the collection jaggard joined together two previously separate texts the first part of the contention betwixt the two famous houses of york and lancaster the early version of henry vi part 2 published by thomas millington in 1594 and 1600 and the true tragedy of richard duke of york the early version of henry vi part 3 published by millington in 1595 and 1600 in 1602 pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from millingtonpericles was printed after the whole contention since their signatures the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence run together but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order the few existing collections vary as jaggard lacked rights to hayes merchant of venice he may also have lacked rights to butters lear and johnsons merry wives there is much about the false folio affair that remains unclear such as subjective questions of jaggards motivation jaggard had a previous odd connection with the shakespeare canon he had printed the questionable miscellany the passionate pilgrim as shakespeares in 1599 and 1612 some shakespeare scholars have wondered why the kings men used jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the first folio just a couple of years after the false folio affair work on the first folio began almost certainly in 1621 it may have been a case of necessity since jaggard had a largecapacity print shop he had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays paviers role in the matter is also debated his initials occur on five of the nine volumes six of the ten plays and some contemporary commentators see paviers role as more significant than jaggards – referring to the books as the pavier quartos instead of the false foliopollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary piracy and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the false folio during the twentieth century by the start of the twentyfirst century some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved a view that no longer casts jaggard and pavier as the villains in a moral contest	group of books	group of books	Written_communication

Textual criticism	"<p><b>Textual criticism</b> is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and of literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants, or different versions, of either manuscripts or of printed books. Such texts may range in dates from the earliest writing in cuneiform, impressed on clay, for example, to multiple unpublished versions of a 21st-century author's work. Historically, scribes who were paid to copy documents may have been literate, but many were simply copyists, mimicking the shapes of letters without necessarily understanding what they meant. This means that unintentional alterations were common when copying manuscripts by hand. Intentional alterations may have been made as well, for example, the censoring of printed work for political, religious or cultural reasons. </p><p>The objective of the textual critic's work is to provide a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of the text and its variants. This understanding may lead to the production of a <b>critical edition</b> containing a scholarly curated text. If a scholar has several versions of a manuscript but no known original, then established methods of textual criticism can be used to seek to reconstruct the original text as closely as possible. The same methods can be used to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history, depending on the number and quality of the text available.</p><p>On the other hand, the one original text that a scholar theorizes to exist is referred to as the urtext (in the context of Biblical studies), archetype or autograph; however, there is not necessarily a single original text for every group of texts. For example, if a story was spread by oral tradition, and then later written down by different people in different locations, the versions can vary greatly. </p><p>There are many approaches or methods to the practice of textual criticism, notably eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, with methods from evolutionary biology (phylogenetics) appearing to be effective on a range of traditions.</p><p>In some domains, such as religious and classical text editing, the phrase ""lower criticism"" refers to textual criticism and ""higher criticism"" to the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text. </p>"	textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship philology and of literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants or different versions of either manuscripts or of printed books such texts may range in dates from the earliest writing in cuneiform impressed on clay for example to multiple unpublished versions of a 21stcentury authors work historically scribes who were paid to copy documents may have been literate but many were simply copyists mimicking the shapes of letters without necessarily understanding what they meant this means that unintentional alterations were common when copying manuscripts by hand intentional alterations may have been made as well for example the censoring of printed work for political religious or cultural reasons the objective of the textual critics work is to provide a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of the text and its variants this understanding may lead to the production of a critical edition containing a scholarly curated text if a scholar has several versions of a manuscript but no known original then established methods of textual criticism can be used to seek to reconstruct the original text as closely as possible the same methods can be used to reconstruct intermediate versions or recensions of a documents transcription history depending on the number and quality of the text availableon the other hand the one original text that a scholar theorizes to exist is referred to as the urtext in the context of biblical studies archetype or autograph however there is not necessarily a single original text for every group of texts for example if a story was spread by oral tradition and then later written down by different people in different locations the versions can vary greatly there are many approaches or methods to the practice of textual criticism notably eclecticism stemmatics and copytext editing quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text with methods from evolutionary biology phylogenetics appearing to be effective on a range of traditionsin some domains such as religious and classical text editing the phrase lower criticism refers to textual criticism and higher criticism to the endeavor to establish the authorship date and place of composition of the original text	branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism	branch of textual scholarship philology and literary criticism	Written_communication
Citation	<p>A <b>citation</b> is a reference to a source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. </p><p>Generally, the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). </p><p>Citations have several important purposes: to uphold intellectual honesty (or avoiding plagiarism), to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.</p><p>The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford, Harvard, MLA, NLM, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use. </p><p>Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgment by other authors of the priority of one's ideas. </p>	a citation is a reference to a source more precisely a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears generally the combination of both the inbody citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not citations have several important purposes to uphold intellectual honesty or avoiding plagiarism to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the authors argument in the claimed way and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has usedthe forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems such as the oxford harvard mla nlm american sociological association asa american psychological association apa and other citations systems because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages editors often specify the citation system to use bibliographies and other listlike compilations of references are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term deliberate acknowledgment by other authors of the priority of ones ideas	reference to a source	reference to a source	Written_communication

Stationers' Register	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Stationers' Register</b> was a record book maintained by the Stationers' Company of London. The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in England. The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of copyright law. The company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books. </p><p>For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—for the Elizabethan era, the Jacobean era, the Caroline era, and especially for English Renaissance theatre—the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the Master of the Revels (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.</p><p>By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work. One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and Nathaniel Butter claimed the right to print ""A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde."" (They paid sixpence.)</p><p>Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the companies of actors appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.</p><p>In 1710, the Copyright Act or Statute of Anne entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register. The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000. </p>"	the stationers register was a record book maintained by the stationers company of london the company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry including printers bookbinders booksellers and publishers in england the register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work and constituted an early form of copyright law the companys charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books for the study of english literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—for the elizabethan era the jacobean era the caroline era and especially for english renaissance theatre—the stationers register is a crucial and essential resource it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else together with the records of the master of the revels which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication the stationers register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of william shakespeare ben jonson and all of their immediate predecessors contemporaries and successorsby paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work one example the stationers register reveals that on 26 november 1607 the stationers john busby and nathaniel butter claimed the right to print a booke called master william shakespeare his historye of kinge lear as yt was played before the kinges maiestie at whitehall vppon sainct stephens night at christmas last by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the globe on the banksyde they paid sixpenceenforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world books were sometimes published without registration and other irregularities also occurred in some cases the companies of actors appear to have registered plays through cooperative stationers with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interestin 1710 the copyright act or statute of anne entered into force superseding company provisions pertaining to the register the company continued to offer some form of registration of works until february 2000	record book of the Stationers' Company of London	record book of the stationers company of london	Written_communication

Printing and the Mind of Man	<p><i><b>Printing and the Mind of Man</b></i> is a book first published in 1967 and based on an exhibition in 1963. </p><p><i><b>PMM</b></i>, as it is usually abbreviated, is regarded as a standard bibliographical reference, and offers a survey of the impact of printed books on the development of western civilization. The book developed from an exhibition put on at two locations to coincide with the 1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition (IPEX). At the behest of typographer Stanley Morison it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at Earls Court concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the British Museum looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. Ian Fleming, who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition. The Fleming Collection so central to the exhibit is now at Indiana University.</p><p>The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of <i>PMM</i>) was printed by Oxford University Press, edited by John Carter, Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: <i>Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16–27 July 1963</i>. </p><p>A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at Cambridge University Press and published in 1967 by Cassell in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York.

Oslo Airport location controversy	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The location of the main airport serving the city of Oslo, Norway, has been the subject of several political debates since 1918. The first controversy was initially related to choice between the islands of Gressholmen and Lindøya in the Oslofjord for a water aerodrome. The debate later changed, arriving at the decision in 1933, to locate a new airport at Fornebu. However, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, being located on a peninsula, proved to not have sufficient space for a runway capable of intercontinental aircraft and a second runway, resulting in plans from the 1960s to replace it. The main contestants were Gardermoen Air Station, Hurum, Hobøl, Ås and a split solution between Fornebu and Gardermoen. In 1992, parliament decided to build an all-new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen; when it opened in 1998, Fornebu was closed. The decision caused the southern parts of Eastern Norway to be moved further from the main airport, and the regional, privately owned Sandefjord Airport, Torp became the base for low-cost airlines.

Tenerife airport disaster	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Tenerife airport disaster</b> occurred on March 27, 1977, when two Boeing 747 passenger jets collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport) on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The collision occurred when <b>KLM Flight 4805</b> initiated its takeoff run while <b>Pan Am Flight 1736</b> was still on the runway. The impact and resulting fire killed everyone on board KLM 4805 and most of the occupants of Pan Am 1736, with only 61 survivors in the front section of the aircraft. Resulting in 583 fatalities, the disaster is the deadliest accident in aviation history. </p><p>A terrorist incident at Gran Canaria Airport had caused many flights to be diverted to Los Rodeos, including the two aircraft involved in the accident. The airport quickly became congested with parked airplanes blocking the only taxiway and forcing departing aircraft to taxi on the runway instead. Patches of thick fog were drifting across the airfield; hence visibility was greatly reduced for pilots and the control tower.</p><p>The subsequent investigation by Spanish authorities concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the KLM captain's decision to take off in the mistaken belief that a takeoff clearance from air traffic control (ATC) had been issued. Dutch investigators placed a greater emphasis on a mutual misunderstanding in radio communications between the KLM crew and ATC, but ultimately KLM admitted that their crew was responsible for the accident and the airline agreed to financially compensate the relatives of all of the victims.</p><p>The disaster had a lasting influence on the industry, highlighting in particular the vital importance of using standardized phraseology in radio communications.

Piccadilly line	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Piccadilly line</b> is a deep-level London Underground line running from the north to the west of London. It has two branches, which split at Acton Town, and serves 53 stations. The line serves Heathrow Airport, and some of its stations are near tourist attractions such as Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. The District and Metropolitan lines share some sections of tracks with the Piccadilly line. Printed in dark blue (officially ""Corporate Blue"", Pantone 072) on the Tube map, it is the fourth-busiest line on the Underground network with over 210 million passenger journeys in 2011/12. </p><p>The first section, between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith, was opened in 1906 as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The station tunnels and buildings were designed by Leslie Green, featuring ox-blood terracotta facades with semi-circular windows on the first floor. When Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL) took over the line, it was renamed the Piccadilly line. Subsequent extensions were made to Cockfosters, Hounslow West and Uxbridge in the early 1930s, when many existing stations on the Uxbridge and Hounslow branches were rebuilt to designs by Charles Holden, part of the Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson architectural practice. These were generally rectangular, with brick bases and large tiled windows, topped with a concrete slab roof. The western extensions took over existing District line services, which were fully withdrawn in 1964. </p><p>Stations in central London were rebuilt to cater for a higher volume of passenger traffic. To prepare for World War II, some stations were equipped with shelters and basic amenities; others were equipped with blast walls. Construction of the Victoria line, the first section of which was opened in 1968, helped to relieve congestion on the Piccadilly line, but some sections of the Piccadilly had to be rerouted for cross-platform interchange with the new line. Several plans were made to extend the Piccadilly line to serve Heathrow Airport. The earliest approval was given in 1967, and the Heathrow extension opened in stages between 1975 and 1977. This extension served only Terminals 2 and 3 and the former Terminal 1. The line was extended again twice, to Terminal 4 via a loop in 1986, and to Terminal 5 directly from the main terminal station in 2008. </p><p>This line has two depots, at Northfields and Cockfosters, with a group of sidings at several locations. Crossovers are at a number of locations, with some allowing for trains to switch onto different lines. The Piccadilly line once had its electricity generated from Lots Road Power Station.

Casualism (art)	"<p><b>Casualism</b> is a 21st-century trend in art which uses color, composition, and balance to produce works with an unusual rather than obviously visually appealing appearance.</p><p>The term Casualism was coined in a 2011 essay which defined a new type of postminimalist painting that features a self-amused, anti-heroic style with an interest in off-kilter composition and impermanence. These artists are interested in a studied, passive-aggressive irresoluteness that reflect wider insights about culture and society Many artists responded positively to the essay and embraced the notion of Casualism, while others rejected the term, suggesting it whiffed of 'labelism' and 'crypto-institutionalism. The Casualist tendency continues to inform much work and conversation around American abstract painting.</p><p>Tatiana Berg, Joe Bradley, Sharon Butler, Amy Feldman, Keltie Ferris, Beth Letain, Lauren Luloff, Chris Martin, Rebecca Morris, David Ostrowski, Cordy Ryman, Michael Voss, and Molly Zuckerman-Hartung are painters who work in a Casualist mode.</p><p>In addition to Casualist, the term ""Provisional"" has been used to describe paintings that might appear unfinished or incomplete; work that is intentionally awkward, physically fragile and unstable, that reject the display of conventional skills, or that discover beauty in unassuming materials. However, Provisional painters, unlike the younger Casualists, suggest a kind of exhaustion, entertaining the impossibility of painting. The older artists whose work is considered Provisional include Raoul De Keyser, Michael Krebber, Mary Heilmann, Kimber Smith, Richard Tuttle and Christopher Wool.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1423 Cached time: 20220514171701 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.412 seconds Real time usage: 0.476 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1479/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 39669/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 427/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 11/100 Expensive parser function count: 2/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 42631/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.243/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5706678/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 430.422 1 -total 47.42% 204.087 19 Template:Cite_web 15.64% 67.319 1 Template:Distinguish 12.16% 52.344 1 Template:Short_description 9.68% 41.666 2 Template:R 6.07% 26.139 2 Template:R/ref 5.79% 24.909 1 Template:Pagetype 5.18% 22.298 2 Template:Cite_book 3.25% 13.980 2 Template:Main_other 2.74% 11.773 2 Template:R/superscript -->"	casualism is a 21stcentury trend in art which uses color composition and balance to produce works with an unusual rather than obviously visually appealing appearancethe term casualism was coined in a 2011 essay which defined a new type of postminimalist painting that features a selfamused antiheroic style with an interest in offkilter composition and impermanence these artists are interested in a studied passiveaggressive irresoluteness that reflect wider insights about culture and society many artists responded positively to the essay and embraced the notion of casualism while others rejected the term suggesting it whiffed of labelism and cryptoinstitutionalism the casualist tendency continues to inform much work and conversation around american abstract paintingtatiana berg joe bradley sharon butler amy feldman keltie ferris beth letain lauren luloff chris martin rebecca morris david ostrowski cordy ryman michael voss and molly zuckermanhartung are painters who work in a casualist modein addition to casualist the term provisional has been used to describe paintings that might appear unfinished or incomplete work that is intentionally awkward physically fragile and unstable that reject the display of conventional skills or that discover beauty in unassuming materials however provisional painters unlike the younger casualists suggest a kind of exhaustion entertaining the impossibility of painting the older artists whose work is considered provisional include raoul de keyser michael krebber mary heilmann kimber smith richard tuttle and christopher wool	philosophical view	philosophical view	Artists

In a 2014 review in the <i>Washington Post</i>, art critic Michael Sullivan wrote that Butler ""creates sketchy, thinly painted washes that hover between representation and abstraction.Though boasting such mechanistic titles as 'Tower Vents' and 'Turbine Study,' Butler’s dreamlike renderings, which use tape to only suggest the roughest outlines of architectural forms, feel like bittersweet homages to urban decay."" Critic Thomas Micchelli proposed that Butler's work shares ""Rauschenberg’s dissolution of the barriers between painting and sculpture,"" particularly where the canvases are ""stapled almost willy-nilly to the front of the stretcher bars, which are visible along the edges of some of the works.""</p><p>Since 2016, her canvases have been based on small daily drawings that she made each day (2016-2020) in a phone app and posted on Instagram.

Fred G. Johnson	"<p><b>Fred G. Johnson</b> (January 1892, Chicago, Illinois – 11 May 1990, Sun City, Arizona) was a prolific sideshow banner artist whose career spanned 65 years. His banner paintings were displayed at the Chicago World's Fair of 1933, called <i>A Century of Progress</i>, and by circuses such as Ringling Brothers, Barnum &amp; Bailey, and Clyde Beatty. He has been called the ""Picasso"" of circus art.</p><p>Fred Johnson, one of nine boys in a Chicago family, was employed at age 14 as an errand boy by the United States Tent &amp; Awning Co. of Chicago, but was soon dismissed for neglecting his work to play baseball. He was hired by banner painter Harry Carlton Cummins to clean equipment and tack up banners. Cummins also taught him to paint banners, though he never received any formal art training. Johnson resumed working for the United States Tent &amp; Awning Co. after World War I, producing banners for owners Walter and Charles Driver between 1921 and 1930.</p><p>Sideshow and circus banners first appeared in Europe during the early 1800s. Hung outside shows or booths, they served the same function as that of decorative shop signs, advertising the contents within. At the height of their popularity from the 1870s to the late 1960s, sideshow banners were strung up at carnivals and traveling shows throughout the world. Early circuses routinely used brightly painted ones to lure paying customers to their quirky sideshows of freaks and curiosities – snake charmers, sword swallowers, two-headed babies and five-legged cows were some of the exaggerated attractions offered for 'your shock and amazement for just five cents!'. Circus banners were usually about 8 feet (2.4 m) high, but commissions could be any size. The largest Johnson ever produced was 50 feet (15 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) ""for a bughouse"" which took him about 40 hours. On average, however, he turned out four a day. He also painted the side-panels on circus trailers and merry-go-rounds.</p><p>Charles Driver later started his own business, taking Johnson with him. When it went bankrupt, Johnson continued to paint banners in a garage on Chicago's northwest side. Undaunted, Driver joined the O. Henry Tent &amp; Awning Co., persuading Johnson to follow him. Johnson worked for that company for some 40 years from 1934 to 1974. </p><p>He later retired at the age of 89 and moved to Sun City, Arizona. He passed away May 11, 1990 at the age of 98. He was survived by son Ellsworth, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p><p>Most of his banners were lost, but survivors are preserved in circus museums in Baraboo, Wisconsin – home to Ringling Brothers – and Sarasota, Florida. as well as in the Carl Hammer gallery. Some were auctioned by Sotheby's in 1981, with titles such as ""Minnie Ha-Ha the Monkey Girl"" and ""Dickie the Penguin Boy"". In July 1989, the State of Illinois Art Center Gallery had an exhibit of his work. His works were subsequently shown by the Rockford Art Museum in 1991, which showcased “Fat Man”, an early work that had not been displayed prior. In an episode of the television show <i>American Pickers</i>, pickers Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz purchased two banners, one of which appraiser William Leroy later identified as being by Johnson. Though not in the best of shape, the pair were valued at $10,000. </p> "	fred g johnson january 1892 chicago illinois – 11 may 1990 sun city arizona was a prolific sideshow banner artist whose career spanned 65 years his banner paintings were displayed at the chicago worlds fair of 1933 called a century of progress and by circuses such as ringling brothers barnum amp bailey and clyde beatty he has been called the picasso of circus artfred johnson one of nine boys in a chicago family was employed at age 14 as an errand boy by the united states tent amp awning co of chicago but was soon dismissed for neglecting his work to play baseball he was hired by banner painter harry carlton cummins to clean equipment and tack up banners cummins also taught him to paint banners though he never received any formal art training johnson resumed working for the united states tent amp awning co after world war i producing banners for owners walter and charles driver between 1921 and 1930sideshow and circus banners first appeared in europe during the early 1800s hung outside shows or booths they served the same function as that of decorative shop signs advertising the contents within at the height of their popularity from the 1870s to the late 1960s sideshow banners were strung up at carnivals and traveling shows throughout the world early circuses routinely used brightly painted ones to lure paying customers to their quirky sideshows of freaks and curiosities – snake charmers sword swallowers twoheaded babies and fivelegged cows were some of the exaggerated attractions offered for your shock and amazement for just five cents circus banners were usually about 8 feet 24 m high but commissions could be any size the largest johnson ever produced was 50 feet 15 m by 15 feet 46 m for a bughouse which took him about 40 hours on average however he turned out four a day he also painted the sidepanels on circus trailers and merrygoroundscharles driver later started his own business taking johnson with him when it went bankrupt johnson continued to paint banners in a garage on chicagos northwest side undaunted driver joined the o henry tent amp awning co persuading johnson to follow him johnson worked for that company for some 40 years from 1934 to 1974 he later retired at the age of 89 and moved to sun city arizona he passed away may 11 1990 at the age of 98 he was survived by son ellsworth three grandchildren and five greatgrandchildrenmost of his banners were lost but survivors are preserved in circus museums in baraboo wisconsin – home to ringling brothers – and sarasota florida as well as in the carl hammer gallery some were auctioned by sothebys in 1981 with titles such as minnie haha the monkey girl and dickie the penguin boy in july 1989 the state of illinois art center gallery had an exhibit of his work his works were subsequently shown by the rockford art museum in 1991 which showcased “ fat man ” an early work that had not been displayed prior in an episode of the television show american pickers pickers mike wolfe and frank fritz purchased two banners one of which appraiser william leroy later identified as being by johnson though not in the best of shape the pair were valued at 10000	American artist (1892-1990)	american artist 18921990	Artists

Malina Suliman	"<p><b>Malina Suliman,</b> a graffiti artist, metalworker, and painter, was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1990. As a child, she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in Kandahar, Afghan. Her work is considered to challenge traditional Muslim culture like the burqa. According to Suliman, ""The burqa is a way of controlling, but in the name of respect. Every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa. It is honor, culture, and religion. Really, it just controls the woman and keeps her inside."" Malina's work has gained the attention of the Taliban and traditional Muslims, resulting in having received threats from the Taliban towards Suliman and her family. The artist was subject to physical threats, rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her work.</p><p>Not only does Malina worry about the Taliban, but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art. Writing art that that displays the human body like Malina's motif, the skeleton in a burqa, is seen as idol worship. To the Taliban and other traditional Muslims, Malina's artwork is un-Islamic and Suliman's parents were embarrassed. Because of this her parents went the distance and locked Malina in their house for nearly a year, which had the opposite effect they were hoping for. Malina claimed that, “Today, whatever I am doing for art, it’s all because of that one year in which I was staying in a home.” Suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world. In December 2019, Malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in Rome but it was cancelled. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1423 Cached time: 20220514215637 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.225 seconds Real time usage: 0.287 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1675/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 10806/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1002/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 0/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 8283/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.124/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3517711/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 268.254 1 -total 65.21% 174.915 1 Template:Infobox_artist 61.96% 166.205 1 Template:Infobox_person 48.80% 130.912 1 Template:Infobox 29.29% 78.576 2 Template:Cite_web 20.80% 55.799 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 15.01% 40.272 1 Template:Birth_year_and_age 7.44% 19.969 16 Template:Main_other 5.29% 14.183 9 Template:Pluralize_from_text 3.06% 8.220 2 Template:Cite_news -->"	malina suliman a graffiti artist metalworker and painter was born in kabul afghanistan in 1990 as a child she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in kandahar afghan her work is considered to challenge traditional muslim culture like the burqa according to suliman the burqa is a way of controlling but in the name of respect every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa it is honor culture and religion really it just controls the woman and keeps her inside malinas work has gained the attention of the taliban and traditional muslims resulting in having received threats from the taliban towards suliman and her family the artist was subject to physical threats rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her worknot only does malina worry about the taliban but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art writing art that that displays the human body like malinas motif the skeleton in a burqa is seen as idol worship to the taliban and other traditional muslims malinas artwork is unislamic and sulimans parents were embarrassed because of this her parents went the distance and locked malina in their house for nearly a year which had the opposite effect they were hoping for malina claimed that “ today whatever i am doing for art it ’ s all because of that one year in which i was staying in a home ” suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world in december 2019 malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in rome but it was cancelled	Afghan artist	afghan artist	Artists

The In der Maur von Berneck family were first granted a coat of arms in 1478, when Hermann In der Maur was appointed as the Ammann of the Abbot of St. Gallen of Berneck— a position the family continued to hold throughout the reigns of the Prince-Abbots of the Abbey of Saint Gall within the Holy Roman Empire. Members of the family also served as Imperial tax collectors and as clerks of the Court of Berneck. The first member of the family to hold the position of Ammann in Berneck was Ulrich In der Maur in 1435. </p><p>After Hans Indermaur von Berneck settled in Rheineck in 1590, the family were granted fiefdoms as vassals, and owned vineyards in the region.

Members of this branch also served as magistrates and clerks of the Courts of Rheineck. </p><p>A branch of the family that settled in South Tyrol were granted coats of arms in 1479, 1491 and 1586. They were elevated to the lower nobility by Rudolf II in 1601 and were then known as von In der Maur auf Strehlburg und zu Freifeld, after their two principle estates in Tyrol: Ansitz Strehlburg and Ansitz Freienfeld. A descendant of this branch, Josef Sebastian Anton Indermauer von Freifeld zu Strelburg, was ennobled in the Kingdom of Bavaria by Maximilian I Joseph in 1813. </p><p>Members of the family have been leading figures in politics, law, and statesmanship including Carl von In der Maur, who served as Governor of Liechtenstein under Johann II, Ignaz Anton von Indermauer, who served as Landvögte of Vorarlberg, Gilbert von In der Maur, who was a Nazi official in Austria, and John Indermaur, who was a solicitor and legal writer in the United Kingdom.

The Brotherhood was only ever a loose association and their principles were shared by other artists of the time, including Ford Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes and Marie Spartali Stillman. Later followers of the principles of the Brotherhood included Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris and John William Waterhouse. </p><p>The group sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian art. They rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name ""Pre-Raphaelite"". In particular, the group objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called ""Sir Sloshua"". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, ""sloshy"" meant ""anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind"". The group associated their work with John Ruskin, an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background. Christian themes were abundant.</p><p>The group continued to accept the concepts of history painting and mimesis, imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, <i>The Germ</i>, to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the <i>Pre-Raphaelite Journal</i>.

Hogarth Club	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Hogarth Club</b> was an exhibition society of artists, based at 84 Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia, London, UK, which existed between 1858 and 1861. It was founded by former members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood after the original PRB had been dissolved. It was envisaged that the club would provide an alternative meeting space and exhibition venue to overcome prejudice against the Pre-Raphaelites at the Royal Academy. Unlike the PRB, the Hogarth Club was established on a professional basis, with two classes of members, artistic and non-artistic, and a distinction between London-based ""resident"" and provincial ""non-resident"" members. </p><p>Ford Madox Brown suggested that the club be named after William Hogarth since Hogarth was ""a painter whom he deeply reverenced as the originator of moral invention and drama in modern art"". Brown and Dante Gabriel Rossetti had worked on some previous independent exhibitions, but became determined to form a permanent exhibition space after the rejection of Pre-Raphaelite work by the Academy in 1857. In response they created their own exhibition, later founding the Hogarth Club in tandem with other sympathetic artists, most notably William Holman Hunt and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope.</p><p>Despite initial success, the Hogarth Club failed to maintain its momentum, and was finally closed in 1861 after failing to adequately build up its membership in the face of hostility from the Royal Academy.

Ancients (art group)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>The Ancients</b> (also known as the <b>Shoreham Ancients</b>) were a group of young English artists and others who were brought together around 1824 by their attraction to archaism in art and admiration for the work of William Blake (1757–1827), who was a generation or two older than the group. The core members of the Ancients were Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the Royal Academy of Arts. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the ""House of Interpreter"" and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the Kent village of Shoreham. The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century. </p><p>They were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic ""brotherhood"", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German Nazarene movement and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world. Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both National Portrait Gallery), which shows a round-necked pleated smock under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard.

For much of his career, Ra led ""The Arkestra"", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. </p><p>Born and raised in Alabama, Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Le Sony'r Ra, shortened to Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian god of the Sun). Claiming to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. Throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying, ""Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym.""</p><p>His widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz, from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz, to swing music, bebop, free jazz and fusion. His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians, along with electronic excursions, songs, chants, percussion pieces, and anthems. From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra (which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations). Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age. Following Ra's illness-forced retirement in 1992, the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra, and, as of 2021, continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen.</p><p>Though his mainstream success was limited, Sun Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer, and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona. He is now widely considered an innovator; among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Over the course of his career, he recorded dozens of singles and over one hundred full-length albums, comprising well over 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century.</p>"	le sonyr ra born herman poole blount may 22 1914 – may 30 1993 better known as sun ra was an american jazz composer bandleader piano and synthesizer player and poet known for his experimental music cosmic philosophy prolific output and theatrical performances for much of his career ra led the arkestra an ensemble with an everchanging name and flexible lineup born and raised in alabama blount became involved in the chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s he soon abandoned his birth name taking the name le sonyr ra shortened to sun ra after ra the egyptian god of the sun claiming to be an alien from saturn on a mission to preach peace he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of afrofuturism throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying any name that i use other than ra is a pseudonymhis widely eclectic and avantgarde music echoed the entire history of jazz from ragtime and early new orleans hot jazz to swing music bebop free jazz and fusion his compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians along with electronic excursions songs chants percussion pieces and anthems from the mid1950s until his death ra led the musical collective the arkestra which featured artists such as marshall allen john gilmore and june tyson throughout its various iterations its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate futuristic costumes inspired by ancient egyptian attire and the space age following ras illnessforced retirement in 1992 the band remained active as the sun ra arkestra and as of 2021 continues performing under the leadership of veteran ra sideman marshall allenthough his mainstream success was limited sun ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona he is now widely considered an innovator among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers over the course of his career he recorded dozens of singles and over one hundred fulllength albums comprising well over 1000 songs making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century	American jazz composer and bandleader (1914–1993)	american jazz composer and bandleader 1914–1993	Artists

Frida Kahlo	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ˈfɾiða ˈkalo]</span>; 6 July 1907 – 13 July 1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary <i>Mexicayotl</i> movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.</p><p>Born to a German father and a <i>mestiza</i> mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoacán – now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum. Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems. During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist. </p><p>Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together. During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs. Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist André Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, <i>The Frame</i>, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection. Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher. She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (""<i>La Esmeralda</i>"") and was a founding member of the <i>Seminario de Cultura Mexicana</i>. Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade. She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47. </p><p>Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists. By the early 1990s, not only had she become a recognized figure in art history, but she was also regarded as an icon for Chicanos, the feminism movement, and the LGBTQ+ movement. Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1412 Cached time: 20220513032405 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.536 seconds Real time usage: 0.672 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 2716/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 32875/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 6500/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 18/100 Expensive parser function count: 8/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 13002/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.341/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 7701081/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 645.255 1 -total 45.98% 296.715 1 Template:Infobox_person 42.18% 272.148 1 Template:Infobox 19.23% 124.106 3 Template:Cite_web 15.96% 102.994 2 Template:Marriage 15.40% 99.380 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 12.13% 78.270 1 Template:Birth_date 9.76% 62.946 1 Template:Short_description 8.77% 56.595 1 Template:Str_≠_len 8.30% 53.555 1 Template:Wdib -->"	magdalena carmen frida kahlo y calderón spanish pronunciation ˈfɾiða ˈkalo 6 july 1907 – 13 july 1954 was a mexican painter known for her many portraits selfportraits and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of mexico inspired by the countrys popular culture she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity postcolonialism gender class and race in mexican society her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy in addition to belonging to the postrevolutionary mexicayotl movement which sought to define a mexican identity kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist she is known for painting about her experience of chronic painborn to a german father and a mestiza mother kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at la casa azul her family home in coyoacán – now publicly accessible as the frida kahlo museum although she was disabled by polio as a child kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18 which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems during her recovery she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist kahlos interests in politics and art led her to join the mexican communist party in 1927 through which she met fellow mexican artist diego rivera the couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in mexico and the united states together during this time she developed her artistic style drawing her main inspiration from mexican folk culture and painted mostly small selfportraits that mixed elements from precolumbian and catholic beliefs her paintings raised the interest of surrealist artist andré breton who arranged for kahlos first solo exhibition at the julien levy gallery in new york in 1938 the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in paris in 1939 while the french exhibition was less successful the louvre purchased a painting from kahlo the frame making her the first mexican artist to be featured in their collection throughout the 1940s kahlo participated in exhibitions in mexico and the united states and worked as an art teacher she taught at the escuela nacional de pintura escultura y grabado la esmeralda and was a founding member of the seminario de cultura mexicana kahlos alwaysfragile health began to decline in the same decade she had her first solo exhibition in mexico in 1953 shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47 kahlos work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists by the early 1990s not only had she become a recognized figure in art history but she was also regarded as an icon for chicanos the feminism movement and the lgbtq movement kahlos work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form	Mexican painter	mexican painter	Artists

The class was the first to include female and minority astronauts; of the 35 selected, six were women, one of them being Jewish American, three were African American, and one was Asian American. Due to the long delay between the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972 and the first flight of the Space Shuttle in 1981, few astronauts from the older groups remained, and they were outnumbered by the newcomers, who became known as the Thirty-Five New Guys (TFNG). Since then, a new group of candidates has been selected roughly every two years. </p><p>In Astronaut Group 8, two different kinds of astronaut were selected: pilots and mission specialists. The group consisted of 15 pilots, all test pilots, and 20 mission specialists. NASA stopped sending non-pilots for one year of pilot training. It also ceased appointing astronauts on selection. Instead, starting with this group, new selections were considered astronaut candidates rather than fully-fledged astronauts until they finished their training. </p><p>Four members of this group, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, and Ronald McNair, died in the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> disaster. These four, plus Shannon Lucid, received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, giving this astronaut class five total recipients of this top NASA award. This is second only to the New Nine class which received seven. The careers of the TFNGs would span the Space Shuttle Program.

Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott. </p><p>Hal Jordan is a former combat pilot who works for Ferris Aircraft as a test pilot, a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps, as well as a founding member of the Justice League, DC's flagship superhero team, alongside well-known heroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers, but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814, which is the sector where Earth resides. His powers derive from his power ring and Green Lantern battery, which in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear allows the user to channel their will power into creating all manner of fantastic constructs. Jordan uses this power to fly, even through the vacuum of space; to create shields, swords, and lasers; and to construct his Green Lantern costume, which protects his secret identity in his civilian life on Earth. Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious Guardians of the Universe, who were developed from an idea editor Julius Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in <i>Strange Adventures #22</i> (July 1952) entitled ""Guardians of the Clockwork Universe"".</p><p>During the 1990s, Jordan also appeared as a villain. The story line <i>Emerald Twilight</i> saw a Jordan traumatized by the supervillain Mongul's destruction of Jordan's hometown Coast City, adopt the name ""Parallax"", and threaten to destroy the universe. In subsequent years, DC Comics rehabilitated the character, first by having Jordan seek redemption for his actions as Parallax, and later by revealing that Parallax was in fact an evil cosmic entity that corrupted Jordan and took control of his actions. Between the character's stint as Parallax and his return to DC Comics as a heroic Green Lantern once more, the character also briefly served as the Spectre, a supernatural character in DC Comics stories who acts as God's wrathful agent on Earth. </p><p>Outside of comics, Hal Jordan has appeared in various animated projects, video games and live-action.

After debuting in <i>All-American Comics</i>, Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, <i>Green Lantern</i>. Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of ""mystery men"" or superheroes in comic books. </p><p>Following World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After eight years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC revisited Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were Green Lanterns on two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Later stories set on Earth-Two depicted Alan becoming the father to the superheroes Obsidian and Jade, each with powers somewhat like his own.

Community Radiative Transfer Model	<p> The <b>Community Radiative Transfer Model </b> (<b>CRTM</b>) is a fast radiative transfer model for calculations of radiances for satellite infrared or microwave radiometers. </p><p>Given an atmospheric profile of temperature, variable gas concentrations, cloud and surface properties CRTM calculates radiances and brightness temperatures. The only mandatory inputs in terms of variable gases are water vapor and ozone. The range of temperatures and water vapour concentrations over which the optical depth computations are valid depends on the training datasets which were used. </p><p>CRTM contains forward, tangent linear, adjoint and K (full Jacobian matrices) versions of the model; the latter three modules are used in inversion methods, including variational assimilation and satellite retrievals. </p><p>The CRTM model is used primarily in numerical weather prediction codes employed by NOAA and NASA. Its primary function is to relate changes in satellite-based observations to changes in the model physical state. This capability is essential to the use of satellite observations in data assimilation methodologies.

It is one of two films produced by Colin Slater's Wolf Tracer Studios. Featuring the voices of Walter Emanuel Jones, Mark Hamill, Jodi Benson, Paige O'Hara and Nancy Cartwright, <i>Believe in Santa</i> tells the story of how suburban boy Ricky Rodgers and his friends spend Christmas after the death of Ricky's mother. </p><p><i>Believe in Santa</i> was broadcast throughout December in broadcast syndication in the top 100 markets, though its most prevalent distribution was through The WB 100+ Station Group, which broadcast The WB over cable and broadcast stations in smaller markets (it did not air on The WB itself as part of its primetime schedule). The special is notable for its production history and overwhelmingly negative reception. Almost every aspect of the special was panned, including its low-quality and ugly looking computer animation and amateur plot, although the voice acting received some minor praise. After a small number of broadcasts during the 2002 holiday season, the special was never officially released on home video and faded into obscurity. A copy of the special was secured from producer and director Colin Slater and uploaded onto the video sharing site Vimeo in 2015.

Alte Brücke (Frankfurt)	"<p><b>Alte Brücke</b> (German: ""old bridge"") is a bridge in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. It is the oldest bridge over the lower course of the river Main, and until 1886 was the only stone bridge crossing the river. From the Middle Ages until the year 1914, it connected the ""Fahrgasse"" in Frankfurt Altstadt with the ""Brückenstraße"" in Sachsenhausen. Since its first mention in official documents in 1222, the development of Frankfurt has been strongly influenced by the bridge. Over the centuries, Alte Brücke has been destroyed and reconstructed at least 18 times. With its 13 brick-built circular arches, the <i>Sachsenhausen Bridge</i> was one of the most prominent buildings of the city, but failing to meet the increasing demands of the modern road and ship traffic, it was demolished in 1914. </p><p>The current Alte Brücke, sometimes called ""Neue Alte Brücke"" (German: ""new old bridge""), was inaugurated on 15 August 1926 by then-Lord-Mayor Ludwig Landmann. Two of its originally eight red sandstone-lined vaults were blown up by German soldiers on 26 March 1945. After an initial provisional reconstruction, the middle part of the bridge was replaced by a steel through truss bridge and placed in operation again on 15 September 1965. </p><p>In 2006, the Alte Brücke received a new porticus, which resembles a watermill that had historically been present at the bridge. Today, the view of the bridge is characterized by four portal walls at both sides of the bridge's middle part. These have been built in the course of a complete renovation in 2014.

Fleisch Bridge	"<p>The <b>Fleisch Bridge</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Fleischbrücke</i> or ""Meat Bridge"") or <b>Pegnitz Bridge</b> (<i>Pegnitzbrücke</i>) is a late Renaissance bridge in Nuremberg, Germany. The bridge crosses the river Pegnitz in the center of the old town, linking the districts St. Sebald and St. Lorenz along the axis of the main market. The single-arch bridge was built between 1596 and 1598 and replaced an earlier mixed construction of stone and wood which had been repeatedly destroyed by flood. </p><p>The Fleisch Bridge is notable for several technical features that were advanced for its time. These include an unusual large width of 15.3 m, and a clear span of 27 m which made it the largest masonry bridge arch in Germany at the time of its construction. With a rise of only 4.2 m, the arch features a span-to-rise ratio of 6.4 to 1, giving the bridge an almost unprecedented flat profile.</p><p>This, however, came at the cost of high lateral thrusts even for a segmental arch bridge. This problem was solved by a particularly innovative construction of the abutments which were built onto 2000 wooden piles, 400 of which were rammed obliquely into the grounds. A very similar arrangement of the abutments had also been implemented slightly earlier at the Rialto bridge, leading to speculations about a technology transfer from Venice, with which Nuremberg shared close trade links. A recent in-depth research, however, stresses the originality of the Fleisch Bridge on grounds of technical differences between the two bridges.</p><p>The Fleisch Bridge has practically remained unchanged since the addition of a portal in 1599 and survived World War II almost unscathed.

Stühlinger Bridge	<p>The <b>Stühlinger bridge</b> was made of prestressed concrete for tramways, pedestrians and cyclists in Freiburg im Breisgau. It connects the Bertoldstraße with the Wannerstraße. In doing so, it crosses the Bismarckallee, the central bus station, the main railway station Hauptbahnhof, the Wetzingerstraße and the Stühlinger Church Square. The right short individual sections make it seem like an inner-city viaduct or an elevated highway in proportion to the whole length. </p><p>The Sühlinger bridge fulfills simultaneously three functions: it connects the Old City district with the Stühlinger district, it is used as a tramway station and as a pedestrian bridge overcrossing the main railway station and gives access to the railway platforms. </p><p>Since 2009, the bridge needs rehabilitation because water infiltrates the concrete. As soon as the rehabilitation is carried out, the cyclists are not allowed to use the bridge anymore and have to use the neighboring Wiwilí Bridge as an alternative one. The reason for this is the height of the guardrails of the bridge, which only rise up to 1,00 meter instead of the latterly legal required 1,20 meters. With the start of the rehabilitation, the hitherto grandfather clause runs out and the regulation is obligatory. The rehabilitation initially planned for 2012 was deferred until August 2012 because of delays and call for bids. Since they were still at the call for bids in the year 2013, it was not possible to make a statement about when it would be rehabilitated in November 2013.

Astrodome (aeronautics)	<p>An <b>astrodome</b> is a hemispherical transparent dome that was installed in the cabin roof of an aircraft. Such a dome would allow a trained navigator to perform astronavigation and thereby guide the aircraft at night without the aid of land-based visual references.</p><p>Astronavigation was a principal early method for attaining an aircraft's position during nighttime by referencing the stars. The practice of sighting stars using a sextant had been commonplace amongst navigators for hundreds of years aboard ships, and proved to be applicable to faster moving aircraft as well, however, the task required a 360-degree view of the horizon. By installing an astrodome, such a view could be readily achieved. The Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted astronavigation techniques into standard navigator training during the late 1930s, both the methodologies used and the design of the sextant were adapted to better suit the aviation environment, while many aircraft ordered by the service would be furnished with astrodomes to enable navigators to use this technique. </p><p>During the Second World War, astronavigation became a critical ability used to by various nations to conduct long distance flights at night, particularly strategic bombing campaigns. The RAF's choice to mainly operate its bombers at night meant that its crews were particularly dependent on astronavigation for finding their way to and from targets. The introduction of electronic means of navigation soon competed with astronavigation, although electronic techniques had their shortcomings as well.</p>	an astrodome is a hemispherical transparent dome that was installed in the cabin roof of an aircraft such a dome would allow a trained navigator to perform astronavigation and thereby guide the aircraft at night without the aid of landbased visual referencesastronavigation was a principal early method for attaining an aircrafts position during nighttime by referencing the stars the practice of sighting stars using a sextant had been commonplace amongst navigators for hundreds of years aboard ships and proved to be applicable to faster moving aircraft as well however the task required a 360degree view of the horizon by installing an astrodome such a view could be readily achieved the royal air force raf adopted astronavigation techniques into standard navigator training during the late 1930s both the methodologies used and the design of the sextant were adapted to better suit the aviation environment while many aircraft ordered by the service would be furnished with astrodomes to enable navigators to use this technique during the second world war astronavigation became a critical ability used to by various nations to conduct long distance flights at night particularly strategic bombing campaigns the rafs choice to mainly operate its bombers at night meant that its crews were particularly dependent on astronavigation for finding their way to and from targets the introduction of electronic means of navigation soon competed with astronavigation although electronic techniques had their shortcomings as well	window dome for astronomical navigation on airplanes	window dome for astronomical navigation on airplanes	Building

This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles. It is also sometimes called Transitional Period. </p><p>The hallmarks of the style include a basically square, boxy design, two-and-one-half stories high, usually with four large, boxy rooms to a floor (with the exception of the attic floor, which typically has only one or two rooms), a center dormer, and a large front porch with wide stairs. The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space, to use a small city lot to best advantage. Other common features included a hipped roof, arched entries between common rooms, built-in cabinetry, and Craftsman-style woodwork. </p><p>A typical design would be as follows: first floor, from front to back, on one side, the living room and dining room; while on the other side, the entry room or foyer, stairway and kitchen. Sometimes a bathroom was also included. Second floor, front to back, on one side, bedroom, bathroom and bedroom; while on the other side, bedroom, stairway and bedroom. The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side-by-side closets between the bedrooms. This gave a very efficient layout, with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway.

Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn	"<p><i><b>Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn</b></i><span> (<span title=""Japanese-language text""><span lang=""ja"">夏秋草図屏風</span></span>)</span> is a painting on a pair of two-folded <i>byōbu</i> folding screens by Rinpa artist Sakai Hōitsu depicting plants and flowers from the autumn and summer seasons. </p><p>Sakai Hōitsu (1761–1828) was a celebrated Japanese painter and an important member of the Rinpa school, particularly famous for his <i>byōbu</i> screens and for reviving the style of Ogata Kōrin, an earlier Rinpa master. </p><p>One of his most celebrated works, <i>Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn</i> consists of a pair of two-folded <i>byōbu</i> folding screens painted with ink and color on silver and gold-foiled paper, measuring 416.6 by 461.8 centimetres (164.0 in × 181.8 in) each. They are designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan.</p><p><i>Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn</i> was originally painted on the back of Kōrin's <i>Wind God and Thunder God</i> screens that belonged to Hōitsu's family. The monumental two-sided <i>byōbu</i> screens became a symbol of the Rinpa tradition, but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage. In the backside of Kōrin's painting of Raijin, Hōitsu painted what has been described as ""summer plants revived by a sudden shower and the swollen flow of a river"", and on the backside of Kōrin's Fūjin, ""autumn plants swaying and the red leaves of ivy blown in a strong wind"".</p><p>The work is dated from the early 19th century, probably circa 1821, and the attribution to Hōitsu has not been disputed. Both screens include the signature-seal ""by Hōitsu"" and a round seal with red letters ""Bunsen"", another name used by Hōitsu.</p><p>Hōitsu's style, which ""aimed for the natural integration of poetic emotion and decorative technique"", has been linked to ""the elegant and refined taste common to poetry, which is another field of art he practiced"". His use of <i>tarashikomi</i> ""to paint plants and flowers with poetic feelings"" has been highly praised. This technique, in which a second layer of paint is applied before the first layer is dry, was perfected by Sōtatsu and used often by later Rinpa artists. </p><p>The screens are now part of the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally. The last time they were on display was from September 21 to October 30, 2016, in Room 8 of the Honkan (Japanese Gallery). Previously they were on display at the Tokyo National Museum in 2008, 2010 and 2013.</p>"	flowering plants of summer and autumn 夏秋草図屏風 is a painting on a pair of twofolded byōbu folding screens by rinpa artist sakai hōitsu depicting plants and flowers from the autumn and summer seasons sakai hōitsu 1761–1828 was a celebrated japanese painter and an important member of the rinpa school particularly famous for his byōbu screens and for reviving the style of ogata kōrin an earlier rinpa master one of his most celebrated works flowering plants of summer and autumn consists of a pair of twofolded byōbu folding screens painted with ink and color on silver and goldfoiled paper measuring 4166 by 4618 centimetres 1640 in × 1818 in each they are designated an important cultural property of japanflowering plants of summer and autumn was originally painted on the back of kōrins wind god and thunder god screens that belonged to hōitsus family the monumental twosided byōbu screens became a symbol of the rinpa tradition but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage in the backside of kōrins painting of raijin hōitsu painted what has been described as summer plants revived by a sudden shower and the swollen flow of a river and on the backside of kōrins fūjin autumn plants swaying and the red leaves of ivy blown in a strong windthe work is dated from the early 19th century probably circa 1821 and the attribution to hōitsu has not been disputed both screens include the signatureseal by hōitsu and a round seal with red letters bunsen another name used by hōitsuhōitsus style which aimed for the natural integration of poetic emotion and decorative technique has been linked to the elegant and refined taste common to poetry which is another field of art he practiced his use of tarashikomi to paint plants and flowers with poetic feelings has been highly praised this technique in which a second layer of paint is applied before the first layer is dry was perfected by sōtatsu and used often by later rinpa artists the screens are now part of the collection of the tokyo national museum where they are exhibited occasionally the last time they were on display was from september 21 to october 30 2016 in room 8 of the honkan japanese gallery previously they were on display at the tokyo national museum in 2008 2010 and 2013	painting by Sakai Hōitsu	painting by sakai hōitsu	Building

Windowpane oyster	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>windowpane oyster</b> (<i>Placuna placenta</i>) is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of Placunidae. They are edible, but valued more for their shells (and the rather small pearls). The shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence. More recently, they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades; in this use, the shell is known as <b>capiz shell</b> (<i>kapis</i>). Capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue, chalk and varnish. </p><p>Distribution extends from the shallows of the Gulf of Aden to around the Philippines, where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. The mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores, in bays, coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft). </p><p>Populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling, dredging, blast fishing and surface-supplied diving. In the Philippines, fisheries are now regulated through permits, quotas, size limits and protected habitats. In spite of this, resources continue to be depleted.</p><p>The nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm (5.9 in) in diameter, reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm (2.8 to 3.9 in). The shell is secured by a V-shaped ligament. Males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads. Fertilization is external and larvae are free-swimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis, eventually settling on the bottom. They consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell; the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide.</p>"	the windowpane oyster placuna placenta is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of placunidae they are edible but valued more for their shells and the rather small pearls the shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence more recently they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades in this use the shell is known as capiz shell kapis capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue chalk and varnish distribution extends from the shallows of the gulf of aden to around the philippines where it is abundant in the eponymous province of capiz the mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores in bays coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m 330 ft populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling dredging blast fishing and surfacesupplied diving in the philippines fisheries are now regulated through permits quotas size limits and protected habitats in spite of this resources continue to be depletedthe nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm 59 in in diameter reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm 28 to 39 in the shell is secured by a vshaped ligament males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads fertilization is external and larvae are freeswimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis eventually settling on the bottom they consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide	species of mollusc	species of mollusc	Building
Bigfin reef squid	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Sepioteuthis lessoniana</b></i>, commonly known as the <b>bigfin reef squid</b>, <b>glitter squid</b> or <b>oval squid</b>, is a species of loliginid squid. It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus <i>Sepioteuthis</i>. Studies in 1993, however, have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex. The species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species. </p><p>Bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle, giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish. They are small to medium-sized squids, averaging 3.8 to 33 centimetres (1.5 to 13.0 in) in length. They exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in May, but it can vary by location. The paralarvae resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching. Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate, reaching 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months. They are a short-lived species, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days. </p><p>The diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish. They are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished extensively for human consumption in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture. They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research. </p>"	sepioteuthis lessoniana commonly known as the bigfin reef squid glitter squid or oval squid is a species of loliginid squid it is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus sepioteuthis studies in 1993 however have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex the species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish they are small to mediumsized squids averaging 38 to 33 centimetres 15 to 130 in in length they exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in may but it can vary by location the paralarvae resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate reaching 600 g 13 lb in only four months they are a shortlived species with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days the diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish they are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the pacific and indian oceans and have recently been introduced into the mediterranean as a lessepsian migrant they are commonly found near the shoreline near rocks and coral reefs they are fished extensively for human consumption in asia because of their rapid growth rate short life span and tolerance to handling and captivity bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture they are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research	species of mollusk	species of mollusk	Building

Statue of Ramesses II	<p>The <b>Statue of Ramesses II</b> is a 3,200-year-old figure of Ramesses II, depicting him standing. It was discovered in 1820 by Giovanni Battista Caviglia at the Great Temple of Ptah near Memphis, Egypt. It is made from red granite and weighs 83 tons. </p><p>The statue was found broken in six pieces and earlier attempts at restoration failed. In 1955, Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser moved it to the large Bab Al-Hadid Square in Cairo, outside Cairo's main railway station; the square was then renamed Ramses Square. There the statue was restored to its full height of 11 meters and erected on a three-metre pedestal at the edge of a fountain. It was stabilized by iron bars inside the body.</p><p>Over time Ramses Square turned out to be an unsuitable location, as the statue was exposed to corrosive pollution and constant vibration from traffic and subways. The Egyptian government decided to relocate it to a more appropriate location in 2006. At a temporary site on the Giza Plateau it underwent restoration before being moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) in Giza in 2018.</p><p>The transportation of the statue from Ramses Square to Giza was a technological challenge that had been in the planning since 2002. A replica had been made and was transported several weeks before the scheduled actual move along the planned route to Giza to test the proposed relocation process. The move took place on August 25, 2006. During its ten-hour transport the statue was wrapped and covered in rubber foam. Two flat-back trucks carried the weight of the statue and its support structures as it travelled in a vertical position.</p><p>The move has been criticized for its costs and the concern about pollution in the Giza location.</p>	the statue of ramesses ii is a 3200yearold figure of ramesses ii depicting him standing it was discovered in 1820 by giovanni battista caviglia at the great temple of ptah near memphis egypt it is made from red granite and weighs 83 tons the statue was found broken in six pieces and earlier attempts at restoration failed in 1955 egyptian prime minister gamal abdel nasser moved it to the large bab alhadid square in cairo outside cairos main railway station the square was then renamed ramses square there the statue was restored to its full height of 11 meters and erected on a threemetre pedestal at the edge of a fountain it was stabilized by iron bars inside the bodyover time ramses square turned out to be an unsuitable location as the statue was exposed to corrosive pollution and constant vibration from traffic and subways the egyptian government decided to relocate it to a more appropriate location in 2006 at a temporary site on the giza plateau it underwent restoration before being moved to the grand egyptian museum gem in giza in 2018the transportation of the statue from ramses square to giza was a technological challenge that had been in the planning since 2002 a replica had been made and was transported several weeks before the scheduled actual move along the planned route to giza to test the proposed relocation process the move took place on august 25 2006 during its tenhour transport the statue was wrapped and covered in rubber foam two flatback trucks carried the weight of the statue and its support structures as it travelled in a vertical positionthe move has been criticized for its costs and the concern about pollution in the giza location	ancient Egyptian statue	ancient egyptian statue	Building

Havmannen	"<p><i><b>Havmannen</b></i>, or <i><b>Havmann</b></i> (in English: ""The Man from the Sea"") is a granite stone sculpture by the English artist Antony Gormley located in the city of Mo i Rana in northern Norway. The sculpture stands proud in the ""Ranfjord"" in the city of Mo i Rana, which is often referred to in Norway as ""Polarsirkelbyen"" (in English: the ""Arctic Circle City""). The sculpture is 11 metres (36 ft) tall, weighs 60 tonnes (59 long tons; 66 short tons), and according to Lonely Planet is ""forever up to his knees in water, turns his back on the town and gazes resolutely out over the fjord"".</p><p>The artist originally envisaged the sculpture being created in steel, based on the traditional steel industry which was one of the pillars of industrial Mo i Rana, and placed in the fjord to illustrate the sharp contrasts between nature and industry. However, the local industry was undergoing major changes at the time, with what was effectively state subsidized and unprofitable factories being closed down, including the local steel works. Realizing the project using local steel therefore became impossible. As a result, Havmann was to become Antony Gormley's first large stone sculpture.) </p><p>The sculpture was created and erected in the Ranfjord in 1995 as part of Artscape Nordland, causing controversy and much debate in the local media, notably in the local paper Rana Blad, which received hundreds of letters and over 300 poems dedicated to the sculpture. The local debate was ongoing for months, and mainly focused on two issues: whether the commissioning of the sculpture was good use of public money, and maybe less serious, a concern about the newly erected sculpture's lack of an erectable device. Despite the initial debate and controversy, citizens of Mo i Rana today take pride in the sculpture by the internationally renowned artist Antony Gormley and have adopted it as an ambassador for the town. The sculpture has inspired and given name to an annual festival, Havmanndagene (the ""Havmann days"") which is held in the city every year in May. </p>"	havmannen or havmann in english the man from the sea is a granite stone sculpture by the english artist antony gormley located in the city of mo i rana in northern norway the sculpture stands proud in the ranfjord in the city of mo i rana which is often referred to in norway as polarsirkelbyen in english the arctic circle city the sculpture is 11 metres 36 ft tall weighs 60 tonnes 59 long tons 66 short tons and according to lonely planet is forever up to his knees in water turns his back on the town and gazes resolutely out over the fjordthe artist originally envisaged the sculpture being created in steel based on the traditional steel industry which was one of the pillars of industrial mo i rana and placed in the fjord to illustrate the sharp contrasts between nature and industry however the local industry was undergoing major changes at the time with what was effectively state subsidized and unprofitable factories being closed down including the local steel works realizing the project using local steel therefore became impossible as a result havmann was to become antony gormleys first large stone sculpture the sculpture was created and erected in the ranfjord in 1995 as part of artscape nordland causing controversy and much debate in the local media notably in the local paper rana blad which received hundreds of letters and over 300 poems dedicated to the sculpture the local debate was ongoing for months and mainly focused on two issues whether the commissioning of the sculpture was good use of public money and maybe less serious a concern about the newly erected sculptures lack of an erectable device despite the initial debate and controversy citizens of mo i rana today take pride in the sculpture by the internationally renowned artist antony gormley and have adopted it as an ambassador for the town the sculpture has inspired and given name to an annual festival havmanndagene the havmann days which is held in the city every year in may	sculpture by Antony Gormley	sculpture by antony gormley	Building

Shi Family Grand Courtyard	<p><b>Shi Family Grand Courtyard</b> (Tiānjīn Shí Jiā Dà Yuàn, 天津石家大院) is situated in Yangliuqing, Xiqing District, which is the former residence of wealthy merchant Shi Yuanshi – the 4th son of Shi Wancheng, one of the eight great masters in Tianjin. First built in 1875, it covers over 6,000 square meters, including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses, a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family. Shifu Garden, which finished its expansion in October 2003, covers 1,200 square meters, incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and delicacy of south garden. Now the courtyard of Shi family covers about 10,000 square meters, which is called the first mansion in North China. Now it serves as the folk custom museum in Yangliuqing, which has a large collection of folk art pieces like Yanliuqing New Year pictures, brick sculpture. </p><p>Shi's ancestor came from Dong'e County in Shandong, engaged in water transport of grain. As the wealth gradually accumulated, the Shi Family moved to Yangliuqing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence. Shi Yuanshi came from the fourth generation of the family, who was a successful businessman and a good household manager, and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale. It is believed to be the first mansion in the west of Tianjin. </p><p>The residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passageway in the middle, on which there are four archways. On the east side of the courtyard, there are traditional single-story houses with rows of rooms around the four sides, which was once the living area for the Shi Family. The rooms on north side were the accountants' office. On the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worshiping Buddha, theater and the south reception room. On both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants. </p><p>Today, the Shi mansion, located in the township of Yangliuqing to the west of central Tianjin, stands as a surprisingly well-preserved monument to China's pre-revolution mercantile spirit. It also serves as an on-location shoot for many of China's popular historical dramas. Many of the rooms feature period furniture, paintings and calligraphy, and the extensive Shifu Garden. </p><p>Part of the complex has been turned into the Yangliuqing Museum, which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyards' construction, local folk art and customs, and traditional period furnishings and crafts. </p>	shi family grand courtyard tiānjīn shí jiā dà yuàn 天津石家大院 is situated in yangliuqing xiqing district which is the former residence of wealthy merchant shi yuanshi – the 4th son of shi wancheng one of the eight great masters in tianjin first built in 1875 it covers over 6000 square meters including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family shifu garden which finished its expansion in october 2003 covers 1200 square meters incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and delicacy of south garden now the courtyard of shi family covers about 10000 square meters which is called the first mansion in north china now it serves as the folk custom museum in yangliuqing which has a large collection of folk art pieces like yanliuqing new year pictures brick sculpture shis ancestor came from donge county in shandong engaged in water transport of grain as the wealth gradually accumulated the shi family moved to yangliuqing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence shi yuanshi came from the fourth generation of the family who was a successful businessman and a good household manager and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale it is believed to be the first mansion in the west of tianjin the residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passageway in the middle on which there are four archways on the east side of the courtyard there are traditional singlestory houses with rows of rooms around the four sides which was once the living area for the shi family the rooms on north side were the accountants office on the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worshiping buddha theater and the south reception room on both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants today the shi mansion located in the township of yangliuqing to the west of central tianjin stands as a surprisingly wellpreserved monument to chinas prerevolution mercantile spirit it also serves as an onlocation shoot for many of chinas popular historical dramas many of the rooms feature period furniture paintings and calligraphy and the extensive shifu garden part of the complex has been turned into the yangliuqing museum which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyards construction local folk art and customs and traditional period furnishings and crafts	building in Wang Jingwei regime, China	building in wang jingwei regime china	Building

Collecting materials for two years through hard work and even visiting the Habsburg monarchy, he finished his <i>Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya</i> in 1762 in the Zograf Monastery. The book was the first attempt to write a complete history of Bulgaria and attempted to awake and strengthen Bulgarian national consciousnesses.</p><p> The most famous part of the whole book is the paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>""Oh, you unwise moron! Why are you ashamed to call yourself a Bulgarian and why don't you read and speak in your native language? Weren't Bulgarians powerful and glorious once?

He is best known for having planned and led the 1519 Spanish expedition to the East Indies across the Pacific Ocean to open a maritime trade route, during which he discovered the interoceanic passage bearing thereafter his name and achieved the first European navigation from the Atlantic to Asia. During this voyage, Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in 1521 in the present-day Philippines. After that, Juan Sebastián Elcano took the lead of the expedition, and with its few other surviving members, in one of the two remaining ships, completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth when they returned to Spain in 1522.</p><p>Born 4 February 1480 into a family of minor Portuguese nobility, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer in service of the Portuguese Crown in Asia. King Manuel I of Portugal refused to support Magellan's plan to reach the Maluku Islands (the ""Spice Islands"") by sailing westwards around the American continent. Facing some criminal offences, Magellan left Portugal and proposed the same expedition to King Charles I of Spain, who accepted it. Consequently, many in Portugal considered him a traitor and he never returned. In Seville, he married, fathered two children, and organised the expedition. For his allegiance to the Hispanic Monarchy, in 1518, Magellan was appointed admiral of the Spanish Fleet and given command of the expedition – the five-ship Armada of Molucca. He was also made Commander of the Order of Santiago, one of the highest military ranks of the Spanish Empire.</p><p>Granted special powers and privileges by the King, he led the Armada from Sanlucar de Barrameda, southwest across the Atlantic Ocean, to the eastern coast of South America, and down to Patagonia. Despite a series of storms and mutinies, the expedition successfully passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Mar del Sur, which Magellan renamed the ""Peaceful Sea"" (the modern Pacific Ocean). The expedition reached Guam and, shortly after, the Philippine islands. There Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521. Under the command of captain Juan Sebastian Elcano, the expedition later reached the Spice Islands. To navigate back to Spain and avoid seizure by the Portuguese, the expedition's two remaining ships split, one attempting, unsuccessfully, to reach New Spain by sailing eastwards across the Pacific, while the other, commanded by Elcano, sailed westwards via the Indian Ocean and up the Atlantic coast of Africa, finally arriving at the expedition's port of departure and thereby completing the first complete circuit of the globe. </p><p>While in the Kingdom of Portugal's service, Magellan had already reached the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia on previous voyages traveling east (from 1505 to 1511–1512). By visiting this area again but now traveling west, Magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.</p>"	ferdinand magellan or portuguese fernão de magalhães ipa fɨɾˈnɐ̃w dɨ mɐɣɐˈʎɐ̃jʃ spanish fernando de magallanes ipa feɾˈnando ðe maɣaˈʎanes 4 february 1480 – 27 april 1521 was a portuguese explorer and a subject of the hispanic monarchy from 1518 he is best known for having planned and led the 1519 spanish expedition to the east indies across the pacific ocean to open a maritime trade route during which he discovered the interoceanic passage bearing thereafter his name and achieved the first european navigation from the atlantic to asia during this voyage magellan was killed in the battle of mactan in 1521 in the presentday philippines after that juan sebastián elcano took the lead of the expedition and with its few other surviving members in one of the two remaining ships completed the first circumnavigation of the earth when they returned to spain in 1522born 4 february 1480 into a family of minor portuguese nobility magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer in service of the portuguese crown in asia king manuel i of portugal refused to support magellans plan to reach the maluku islands the spice islands by sailing westwards around the american continent facing some criminal offences magellan left portugal and proposed the same expedition to king charles i of spain who accepted it consequently many in portugal considered him a traitor and he never returned in seville he married fathered two children and organised the expedition for his allegiance to the hispanic monarchy in 1518 magellan was appointed admiral of the spanish fleet and given command of the expedition – the fiveship armada of molucca he was also made commander of the order of santiago one of the highest military ranks of the spanish empiregranted special powers and privileges by the king he led the armada from sanlucar de barrameda southwest across the atlantic ocean to the eastern coast of south america and down to patagonia despite a series of storms and mutinies the expedition successfully passed through the strait of magellan into the mar del sur which magellan renamed the peaceful sea the modern pacific ocean the expedition reached guam and shortly after the philippine islands there magellan was killed in the battle of mactan in april 1521 under the command of captain juan sebastian elcano the expedition later reached the spice islands to navigate back to spain and avoid seizure by the portuguese the expeditions two remaining ships split one attempting unsuccessfully to reach new spain by sailing eastwards across the pacific while the other commanded by elcano sailed westwards via the indian ocean and up the atlantic coast of africa finally arriving at the expeditions port of departure and thereby completing the first complete circuit of the globe while in the kingdom of portugals service magellan had already reached the malay archipelago in southeast asia on previous voyages traveling east from 1505 to 1511–1512 by visiting this area again but now traveling west magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history	Portuguese explorer in the service of Spain	portuguese explorer in the service of spain	City

List of Spider-Man enemies	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Spider-Man is a superhero created by Marvel Comics who debuted in the anthology comic book series issue <i>Amazing Fantasy</i> #15 (August 1962) during the Silver Age of Comics and is Marvel's most popular superhero. After his debut, he got his own comic book entitled <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>. This comic introduced many of what would become his major supervillain adversaries. Spider-Man then became popular enough for more Spider-Man comic spinoffs (<i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i>, <i>Marvel Team-Up</i>, <i>Web of Spider-Man</i>, <i>Peter Parker: Spider-Man</i> etc.) which introduced more recurring enemies of the web-slinger, across their various incarnations. </p><p>As with Spider-Man, most of his villains' powers originate from scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology. They can be classified into multiple categories, such as animal-themed villains (Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Lizard, Rhino, Scorpion, Jackal, Beetle, Kangaroo, Tarantula, and Puma), those with powers over the elements (Sandman, Electro, Molten Man, and Hydro-Man), horror-themed villains (the Green Goblin, the Hobgoblin, Morbius, Morlun, and the Symbiotes), crime lords (the Kingpin, Tombstone, Hammerhead, Silvermane, and Mister Negative), inventors (the Shocker, the Tinkerer, Spencer Smythe, and Alistair Smythe), and masters of trickery and illusion (the Chameleon and Mysterio). There are, however, numerous villains that don't fit into any specific category, such as Kraven the Hunter and Mephisto, the latter of whom originated as a Silver Surfer villain. The villains oftentimes form teams such as the Sinister Six to oppose the web-slinger. </p><p>Spider-Man is notable for having numerous villains that redeemed themselves and became antiheroes, such as Black Cat, the Prowler, Morbius, Kraven, and Silver Sable. Also, unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man doesn't have one particular archenemy, but rather three: the Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and the Eddie Brock version of Venom, the latter two of whom have been similarly redeemed and depicted as antiheroes. </p><p>The rogues gallery of Spider-Man has garnered positive critical acclaim and has been considered one of the greatest rogues galleries of all time. </p> "	spiderman is a superhero created by marvel comics who debuted in the anthology comic book series issue amazing fantasy 15 august 1962 during the silver age of comics and is marvels most popular superhero after his debut he got his own comic book entitled the amazing spiderman this comic introduced many of what would become his major supervillain adversaries spiderman then became popular enough for more spiderman comic spinoffs the spectacular spiderman marvel teamup web of spiderman peter parker spiderman etc which introduced more recurring enemies of the webslinger across their various incarnations as with spiderman most of his villains powers originate from scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology they can be classified into multiple categories such as animalthemed villains doctor octopus vulture lizard rhino scorpion jackal beetle kangaroo tarantula and puma those with powers over the elements sandman electro molten man and hydroman horrorthemed villains the green goblin the hobgoblin morbius morlun and the symbiotes crime lords the kingpin tombstone hammerhead silvermane and mister negative inventors the shocker the tinkerer spencer smythe and alistair smythe and masters of trickery and illusion the chameleon and mysterio there are however numerous villains that dont fit into any specific category such as kraven the hunter and mephisto the latter of whom originated as a silver surfer villain the villains oftentimes form teams such as the sinister six to oppose the webslinger spiderman is notable for having numerous villains that redeemed themselves and became antiheroes such as black cat the prowler morbius kraven and silver sable also unlike most superheroes spiderman doesnt have one particular archenemy but rather three the norman osborn version of the green goblin doctor octopus and the eddie brock version of venom the latter two of whom have been similarly redeemed and depicted as antiheroes the rogues gallery of spiderman has garnered positive critical acclaim and has been considered one of the greatest rogues galleries of all time	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Comics_characters

Wonder Woman	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Wonder Woman</b> is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in <i>All Star Comics</i> #8 published October 21, 1941 with her first feature in <i>Sensation Comics</i> #1 in January 1942. The <i>Wonder Woman</i> title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously ever since. In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is <b>Princess Diana of Themyscira</b>. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince.</p><p>Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's appearance.</p><p>Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology. </p><p>Wonder Woman's character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis forces as well as an assortment of colorful supervillains, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman freeing herself from bondage, which counterpointed the ""damsels in distress"" trope that was common in comics during the 1940s. In the decades since her debut, Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on destroying her, including classic villains such as Ares, Cheetah, Doctor Poison, Circe, Doctor Psycho, and Giganta, along with more recent adversaries such as Veronica Cale and the First Born. Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams Justice Society (from 1941) and Justice League (from 1960).</p><p>The character is an archetypical figure in popular culture that has been adapted to various media. October 21 is Wonder Woman Day, commemorating the release of her first appearance in <i>All Star Comics</i> #8 (with the exception of 2017 which held the day on June 3 to tie in with the release of the film of the same name).</p><p>Wonder Woman has been featured in various media from radio to television and film, and appears in merchandise sold around the world, such as apparel, toys, dolls, jewelry, and video games. Shannon Farnon, Susan Eisenberg, Maggie Q, Lucy Lawless, Keri Russell, Rosario Dawson, Cobie Smulders, Rachel Kimsey and Stana Katic among others, have provided the character's voice for animated adaptations.

Alan Scott	"<p><b>Alan Scott</b> is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, and the first character to bear the name <b>Green Lantern</b>. He fights evil with the aid of a magical ring which grants him a variety of powers. He was created by Martin Nodell and Bill Finger, first appearing in the comic book <i>All-American Comics</i> #16, published in 1940.</p><p>Alan Scott was created after Nodell became inspired by the characters from Greek, Norse, and Middle Eastern myths and tales, including Aladdin from <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>, and sought to create a popular entertainment character who fought evil with the aid of a magic ring that grants him a variety of supernatural powers. After debuting in <i>All-American Comics</i>, Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, <i>Green Lantern</i>. Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of ""mystery men"" or superheroes in comic books. </p><p>Following World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After eight years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC revisited Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were Green Lanterns on two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Later stories set on Earth-Two depicted Alan becoming the father to the superheroes Obsidian and Jade, each with powers somewhat like his own. In 1985, DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, merging Earth-One and Earth-Two and re-establishing Alan as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, coexisting with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. </p><p>In 2011, DC's New 52 introduced a new Multiverse, depicting a young Earth-Two version of Alan who was an out gay man.

The Shadow	"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p><i><b>The Shadow</b></i> is a collection of serialized dramas, originally in 1930s pulp novels and later in multiple media. Its title character has been featured on radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five feature films. The radio drama include episodes voiced by Orson Welles. </p><p>The Shadow, originally created to be a mysterious radio show narrator, was developed into a distinct literary character in 1931 by writer Walter B. Gibson. </p><p>The Shadow debuted on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the radio program <i>Detective Story Hour</i>, which was developed to boost sales of Street &amp; Smith's monthly pulp <i>Detective Story Magazine</i>. When listeners of the program began asking at newsstands for copies of ""that Shadow detective magazine"", Street &amp; Smith launched a magazine based on the character, and hired Gibson to create a concept to fit the name and voice and to write a story featuring him. The first issue of the pulp series <i>The Shadow Magazine</i> went on sale April 1, 1931. </p><p>On September 26, 1937, <i>The Shadow</i>, a new radio drama based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine, premiered with the story ""The Death House Rescue"", in which The Shadow was characterized as having ""the hypnotic power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him"". In the magazine stories, The Shadow did not become literally invisible. </p><p>The introductory line from the radio adaptation of <i>The Shadow</i> – ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!"" – spoken by actor Frank Readick, has earned a place in the American idiom. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Saëns' <i>Le Rouet d'Omphale</i> (""Omphale's Spinning Wheel,"" composed in 1872). </p><p>The Shadow, at the end of each episode, reminded listeners, ""The weed of crime bears bitter fruit! Crime does not pay...The Shadow knows!"" </p><p>Some early episodes used the alternate statement, ""As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil!

Jaguar (Archie Comics)	"<p><b>The Jaguar</b> is a superhero first published in 1961 by Archie Comics. He was created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger as part of Archie's ""Archie Adventure Series"". This happened prior to that comics line being camped up as part of their Mighty Comics imprint. </p><p>The Jaguar is zoologist Ralph Hardy. While on a dig in Peru, (Hardy, like most Silver Age heroes, is a man of many interests and talents, including archeology), a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. While the others fled, Hardy followed a rare white jaguar into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster, as well as a mystical ""nucleon energy belt"". The round golden buckle of the belt had the engraved image of a winged Jaguar on the front and on the back an inscription which read: ""He who loves the animal kingdom may wear this belt and be transformed into a human Jaguar"". Hardy put on the belt and was instantly transformed.</p><p>As The Jaguar, he possesses, in addition to the expected feline abilities, all the powers of the animal kingdom, only a thousand times more powerful. The oft-quoted ""magnified toughness of a rhinoceros' hide"", for example, gives him near Superman-level invulnerability. He also has the Aquaman-style telepathic ability to mentally communicate with and command all animals, including those from alien worlds. </p><p>The Jaguar wears a simple, skintight scarlet bodysuit with a flared black collar and the stylized suggestion of a feline face (just the eyes, whiskers, and open mouth) on the chest and jaguar pelt-patterned boots and nucleon belt. The latter has two small rocket packs on either side which gives him the power of supersonic flight. He wears no mask and looks exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy has a mustache, while The Jaguar does not. (Post-Silver Age comics artists tend to give the latter pointed ears and a more cat-like hairstyle, making him vaguely resemble a cross between the Sub-Mariner and the movie version of Wolverine.) </p><p>In many ways The Jaguar is a copy of earlier Archie Comics hero The Fly: magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than the insect kingdom, etc. The Jaguar first appeared two years after The Fly was introduced. </p><p>Unlike The Fly, however, The Jaguar is handsome and has many recurring romantic entanglements. These include the immortal feline sorceress Cat Girl, who had command over the cat kingdom, just as he ruled over the whole animal kingdom. (She was also known as The Sphinx and had originally battled The Fly, but it was quickly decided that she would be a more appropriate foe for The Jaguar.) There is also the green-skinned and white-haired undersea siren Kree-Nal, and Hardy's secretary Jill Ross. Like Pete Ross, she secretly knows that Hardy is her beloved hero The Jaguar and uses that knowledge to help him without him knowing it. Nor were these relationships static; in later stories, Jill left to study nursing so that she could better assist in Hardy's veterinary work. </p><p>Cat Girl lost her magic powers due to exposure to highly toxic strontium-90 from atomic testing, retaining only her telepathic mastery over cats. She took on the new mortal identity of jet-set socialite Lydia Fellin, whose ""family fortune"" was actually a vast treasure trove that she had accumulated over the centuries. </p><p>The Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of <i>The Adventures of the Jaguar</i>, as well as a backup feature in other Archie titles: <i>Jughead Jones Comic Digest</i> 7; <i>Laugh Comics</i> 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140–142, 144; <i>Laugh Comics Digest</i> 25, 27; <i>Pep Comics</i> 150, 152, 157, 159, and 168. The Jaguar also appears in <i>The Adventures of the Fly</i> #23. When the ""Archie Adventure Series"" line was canceled and reborn as Archie's ""camped up"" Mighty Comics line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in <i>Mighty Crusaders</i> #4 and 5. In #5 The Jaguar would team up with Mr. Justice and Steel Sterling as the ""Terrific Three"". </p><p>The Jaguar would again appear as part of Archie's Red Circle Comics revamp in the 1980s, as a founding member of the new <i>Mighty Crusaders</i>. He was also a backup series in <i>The Fly</i> issues 4–9. In this incarnation it was revealed that the source of The Jaguar's powers was the cherubim-like pre-human god Varigon, Lord of the Animals, a towering golden-winged being with three heads: a bird, a lion, and a bull. Varigon had created the magic belt as a weapon to be worn by his mortal champion in the eternal battle against the scaly green lizard-headed S'ithh, Lord of the Reptiles, who wanted the dinosaurs to rule the Earth once again. The first person to have worn the belt in ancient times was an Incan woman. </p><p>It is later revealed that Ralph is the brother of Rose Raymond, the wife of fellow superhero The Web.</p><p>The most recent appearances of the Ralph Hardy Jaguar have been cameos in <i>Archie's Weird Mysteries</i> #3 and 14 and a cover story crossover appearance in <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i> #30. </p><p>A teenage female version of The Jaguar, written by William Messner-Loebs, was used in DC Comics' <i>Impact</i> revamp of the Archie superheroes. She is naive and good-hearted Maria DeGuzman, who came to North America from Rio de Janeiro to study at Elm Harbor University. To her surprise, she inherited from her late aunt the werewolf-like ability to transform into a large, muscular, barefoot and green-eyed Jaguar. Despite wearing a similar, somewhat skimpier skintight red outfit, unlike her male namesake, this ferocious feline's powers are limited to superhuman strength and agility combined with cat-like claws and senses. She eventually marries Impact's version of The Fly at the end of the <i>Crucible</i> miniseries.</p><p>In the aftermath of the continuity-altering Final Crisis, DC comics once again licensed the Red Circle heroes, this time choosing to bring them directly into the DC Universe. In March 2010 a new Jaguar was set to appear in <i>The Shield</i> #5, a Brazilian man who could transform into a red tattoo-covered ""werejaguar"".</p><p>In <i>New Crusaders</i> the role of The Jaguar in the short-lived Red Circle digital comics universe was passed to Ralph Hardy's young apprentice Ivette ""Ivy"" Velez when the shy, Spanish-speaking orphan was given the cat-like golden helmet of Ai Apaec to become the savage new Jaguar.</p>"	the jaguar is a superhero first published in 1961 by archie comics he was created by writer robert bernstein and artist john rosenberger as part of archies

Salem Saberhagen	<p><b>Salem Saberhagen</b> is a fictional character from the American Archie Comics comic series <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i>. Salem is an American Shorthair cat who lives with Sabrina Spellman, Hilda Spellman and Zelda Spellman in the fictional town of Greendale, located near Riverdale. A formerly human witch, Salem was sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a cat, as punishment for trying to take over the world. Salem first appeared alongside Sabrina in <i>Archie's Mad House</i> #22 in 1962, and was created by George Gladir and Dan DeCarlo. </p><p>Earlier comics portray Salem as a normal orange-colored feline who does not speak. With the debut and success of the 1990s live-action <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i> sitcom, Salem's backstory and character underwent several retcons to bring it more in line with the sitcom's version. A late 1990s story initially revealed Salem was turned into a cat for jilting Enchantra, the Head Witch, at the altar. A similar version of events was presented in a 1990s live-action television film, where he was imprisoned in the form of a cat for attempting to use his magic to make a mortal love him. However, the comics eventually gave Salem a similar backstory that was shown in the sitcom and its spinoff, <i>Sabrina: The Animated Series</i>. Further details about Salem's past before his transformation into a cat were revealed in the 2000s manga-inspired version of the comic, written and drawn by Tania del Rio.</p><p>In the graphic novel <i>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i>, Salem is given a more serious role to fit with the series' darker tone. In this version, Salem often acts as a conscience to Sabrina, questioning her hot-headed or more daring ideas. </p>	salem saberhagen is a fictional character from the american archie comics comic series sabrina the teenage witch salem is an american shorthair cat who lives with sabrina spellman hilda spellman and zelda spellman in the fictional town of greendale located near riverdale a formerly human witch salem was sentenced by the witchs council to spend 100 years as a cat as punishment for trying to take over the world salem first appeared alongside sabrina in archies mad house 22 in 1962 and was created by george gladir and dan decarlo earlier comics portray salem as a normal orangecolored feline who does not speak with the debut and success of the 1990s liveaction sabrina the teenage witch sitcom salems backstory and character underwent several retcons to bring it more in line with the sitcoms version a late 1990s story initially revealed salem was turned into a cat for jilting enchantra the head witch at the altar a similar version of events was presented in a 1990s liveaction television film where he was imprisoned in the form of a cat for attempting to use his magic to make a mortal love him however the comics eventually gave salem a similar backstory that was shown in the sitcom and its spinoff sabrina the animated series further details about salems past before his transformation into a cat were revealed in the 2000s mangainspired version of the comic written and drawn by tania del rioin the graphic novel chilling adventures of sabrina salem is given a more serious role to fit with the series darker tone in this version salem often acts as a conscience to sabrina questioning her hotheaded or more daring ideas	fictional character from Sabrina the Teenage Witch	fictional character from sabrina the teenage witch	Comics_characters

The character was created by writer Norman Danberg and artist Will Harr, although another creative team, writer Joe Blair and artist Ed Smalle, produced most of his adventures.</p><p>Rang-a-Tang is a circus-trained German shepherd who solves crimes at a movie studio in Hollywood, California, with the help of detective Hy Speed and former child actor Richy the Amazing Boy. The unusually intelligent dog, described as having an ""almost-human brain"", can understand human speech, including the person's tone of voice and moral character.

The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero Batman. The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in <i>Detective Comics</i> #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. Robin's early adventures included <i>Star Spangled Comics</i> #65–130 (1947–1952), the character's first solo feature. He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s, until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing. As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the <i>Caped Crusaders</i> and the <i>Dynamic Duo</i>.</p><p>The character's second incarnation, Jason Todd, first appeared in <i>Batman</i> #357 (1983). He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books until 1988, when he was murdered by the Joker in the storyline ""A Death in the Family"" (1989). Jason later found himself alive after a reality-changing incident, eventually becoming the Red Hood. The premiere <i>Robin</i> limited series was published in 1991, featuring the character's third incarnation, Tim Drake, training to earn the role of Batman's vigilante partner. After two successful sequels, the monthly <i>Robin</i> series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character Stephanie Brown became the fourth Robin for a short time before the role reverted to Tim Drake. Damian Wayne succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc ""Battle for the Cowl."" </p><p>The current and former Robins always feature prominently in Batman's cast of supporting heroes; Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian all regard him as a father. In current continuity as of 2021, Dick Grayson serves as Nightwing, Jason Todd is the Red Hood, Stephanie Brown is Batgirl, and Tim Drake has picked up the mantle of Robin again after a stint as Red Robin. Damian has left behind the title Robin, but remains the title character of the <i>Robin</i> comic book. In recent years, Batman has also adopted new sidekicks in the form of Bluebird, whose name references Robin, and The Signal. </p>"	robin is the alias of several fictional superheroes appearing in american comic books published by dc comics the character was originally created by bob kane bill finger and jerry robinson to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero batman the characters first incarnation dick grayson debuted in detective comics 38 april 1940 conceived as a way to attract young readership robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception doubling the sales of the batman titles robins early adventures included star spangled comics 65–130 1947–1952 the characters first solo feature he made regular appearances in batmanrelated comic books and other dc comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s until the character set aside the robin identity and became the independent superhero nightwing as a team batman and robin have commonly been referred to as the caped crusaders and the dynamic duothe characters second incarnation jason todd first appeared in batman 357 1983 he made regular appearances in batmanrelated comic books until 1988 when he was murdered by the joker in the storyline a death in the family 1989 jason later found himself alive after a realitychanging incident eventually becoming the red hood the premiere robin limited series was published in 1991 featuring the characters third incarnation tim drake training to earn the role of batmans vigilante partner after two successful sequels the monthly robin series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009 which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right in 2004 storylines established dc comics character stephanie brown became the fourth robin for a short time before the role reverted to tim drake damian wayne succeeds drake as robin in the 2009 story arc battle for the cowl the current and former robins always feature prominently in batmans cast of supporting heroes dick jason tim and damian all regard him as a father in current continuity as of 2021 dick grayson serves as nightwing jason todd is the red hood stephanie brown is batgirl and tim drake has picked up the mantle of robin again after a stint as red robin damian has left behind the title robin but remains the title character of the robin comic book in recent years batman has also adopted new sidekicks in the form of bluebird whose name references robin and the signal	several DC Comics characters	several dc comics characters	Comics_characters

Windowpane oyster	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>windowpane oyster</b> (<i>Placuna placenta</i>) is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of Placunidae. They are edible, but valued more for their shells (and the rather small pearls). The shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence. More recently, they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades; in this use, the shell is known as <b>capiz shell</b> (<i>kapis</i>). Capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue, chalk and varnish. </p><p>Distribution extends from the shallows of the Gulf of Aden to around the Philippines, where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. The mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores, in bays, coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft). </p><p>Populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling, dredging, blast fishing and surface-supplied diving. In the Philippines, fisheries are now regulated through permits, quotas, size limits and protected habitats. In spite of this, resources continue to be depleted.</p><p>The nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm (5.9 in) in diameter, reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm (2.8 to 3.9 in). The shell is secured by a V-shaped ligament. Males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads. Fertilization is external and larvae are free-swimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis, eventually settling on the bottom. They consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell; the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide.</p>"	the windowpane oyster placuna placenta is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of placunidae they are edible but valued more for their shells and the rather small pearls the shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence more recently they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades in this use the shell is known as capiz shell kapis capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue chalk and varnish distribution extends from the shallows of the gulf of aden to around the philippines where it is abundant in the eponymous province of capiz the mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores in bays coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m 330 ft populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling dredging blast fishing and surfacesupplied diving in the philippines fisheries are now regulated through permits quotas size limits and protected habitats in spite of this resources continue to be depletedthe nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm 59 in in diameter reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm 28 to 39 in the shell is secured by a vshaped ligament males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads fertilization is external and larvae are freeswimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis eventually settling on the bottom they consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide	species of mollusc	species of mollusc	Foods
Bigfin reef squid	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Sepioteuthis lessoniana</b></i>, commonly known as the <b>bigfin reef squid</b>, <b>glitter squid</b> or <b>oval squid</b>, is a species of loliginid squid. It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus <i>Sepioteuthis</i>. Studies in 1993, however, have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex. The species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species. </p><p>Bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle, giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish. They are small to medium-sized squids, averaging 3.8 to 33 centimetres (1.5 to 13.0 in) in length. They exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in May, but it can vary by location. The paralarvae resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching. Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate, reaching 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months. They are a short-lived species, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days. </p><p>The diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish. They are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished extensively for human consumption in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture.

Albanian cuisine	"<p>The <b>Albanian cuisine</b> (Albanian: <i lang=""sq"">kuzhina shqiptare</i> <small></small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[kuˈʒina ʃcipˈtaɾɛ]</span>) is a representative of the cuisine of the Mediterranean. It is also an example of the Mediterranean diet based on the importance of olive oil, fruits, vegetables and fish. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse in consequence of the environmental factors that are more importantly suitable for the cultivation of nearly every kind of herbs, vegetables and fruits. Olive oil is the most ancient and commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts.</p><p>Hospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honour, called <i>besa</i>, resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.</p><p>Albanian cuisine can be divided into three major regional cuisines. The cuisine of the northern region has a rural, coastal and mountainous origin. Meat, fish and vegetables are central to the cuisine of the northern region. The people there use many kinds of ingredients, which usually grow in the region including potatoes, carrots, maizes, beans, cabbages but also cherries, walnuts and almonds. Garlic and onions are as well important components to the local cuisine and added to almost every dish. </p><p>The cuisine of the central region is threefold of rural, mountainous and coastal. The central region is the flattest and rich in vegetation and biodiversity as well as culinary specialties. It has Mediterranean characteristics due to its proximity to the sea, which is rich in fish.

It shares characteristics with other Balkan cuisines. Bulgarian cooking traditions are diverse because of geographical factors such as climatic conditions suitable for a variety of vegetables, herbs, and fruit. Aside from the vast variety of local Bulgarian dishes, Bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with Persian, Turkish, and Greek cuisine. </p><p>Bulgarian food often incorporates salads as appetizers and is also noted for the prominence of dairy products, wines and other alcoholic drinks such as rakia. The cuisine also features a variety of soups, such as the cold soup tarator, and pastries, such as the filo dough based banitsa, pita, and the various types of burek. </p><p>Main courses are very typically water-based stews, either vegetarian or with lamb, goat meat, veal, chicken or pork. Deep-frying is not common, but grilling – especially different kinds of sausages – is very prominent. Pork is common, often mixed with veal or lamb, although fish and chicken are also widely used. While most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, veal is popular for grilling meat appetizers (meze) and in some main courses. As a substantial exporter of lamb, Bulgaria's own consumption is notable, especially in the spring.</p><p>Similarly to other Balkan cultures, the per capita consumption of yogurt (Bulgarian: кисело мляко, <i>kiselo mlyako, lit.</i> ""sour milk"") among Bulgarians is traditionally higher than the rest of Europe. The country is notable as the historical namesake for <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, a microorganism chiefly responsible for the local variety of dairy product.</p><p>Bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with Middle Eastern cuisine, including popular dishes like moussaka, gyuvetch, kyufte and baklava. White brine cheese called ""sirene"" (сирене), similar to feta, is also a popular ingredient used in salads and a variety of pastries. </p><p>Holidays are often observed in conjunction with certain meals. On Christmas Eve, for instance, tradition requires vegetarian stuffed peppers and cabbage leaf sarmi, New Year's Eve usually involves cabbage dishes, Nikulden (Day of St. Nicholas, December 6) fish (usually carp), while Gergyovden (Day of St. George, May 6) is typically celebrated with roast lamb. </p>"	bulgarian cuisine bulgarian българска кухня romanized bǎlgarska kuhnja is a representative of the cuisine of southeast europe it shares characteristics with other balkan cuisines bulgarian cooking traditions are diverse because of geographical factors such as climatic conditions suitable for a variety of vegetables herbs and fruit aside from the vast variety of local bulgarian dishes bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with persian turkish and greek cuisine bulgarian food often incorporates salads as appetizers and is also noted for the prominence of dairy products wines and other alcoholic drinks such as rakia the cuisine also features a variety of soups such as the cold soup tarator and pastries such as the filo dough based banitsa pita and the various types of burek main courses are very typically waterbased stews either vegetarian or with lamb goat meat veal chicken or pork deepfrying is not common but grilling – especially different kinds of sausages – is very prominent pork is common often mixed with veal or lamb although fish and chicken are also widely used while most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat veal is popular for grilling meat appetizers meze and in some main courses as a substantial exporter of lamb bulgarias own consumption is notable especially in the springsimilarly to other balkan cultures the per capita consumption of yogurt bulgarian кисело мляко kiselo mlyako lit sour milk among bulgarians is traditionally higher than the rest of europe the country is notable as the historical namesake for lactobacillus bulgaricus a microorganism chiefly responsible for the local variety of dairy productbulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with middle eastern cuisine including popular dishes like moussaka gyuvetch kyufte and baklava white brine cheese called sirene сирене similar to feta is also a popular ingredient used in salads and a variety of pastries holidays are often observed in conjunction with certain meals on christmas eve for instance tradition requires vegetarian stuffed peppers and cabbage leaf sarmi new years eve usually involves cabbage dishes nikulden day of st nicholas december 6 fish usually carp while gergyovden day of st george may 6 is typically celebrated with roast lamb	culinary traditions of Bulgaria	culinary traditions of bulgaria	Foods

Strained yogurt	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Strained yogurt</b>, <b>Greek yogurt</b>, <b>yogurt cheese</b>, <b>sack yogurt</b>, or <b>kerned yogurt</b> is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than normal unstrained yogurt, while still preserving the distinctive sour taste of yogurt. Like many types, strained yogurt is often made from milk enriched by boiling off some water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free cow's milk. In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made. </p><p>Strained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as ""Greek yogurt"" and in the UK as ""Greek-style yogurt"", though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine, Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian cuisines, where it is often used in cooking, as it curdles less readily when cooked. It is used in a variety of dishes, cooked or raw, savory or sweet. Straining makes even nonfat varieties thicker, richer, and creamier than unstrained. Since straining removes the whey, more milk is required to make strained yogurt, increasing the production cost. Thickeners such as pectin, locust bean gum, starches or guar gum may also be used to thicken yogurts. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the lactose, strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.</p><p>It was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion American yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as ""Greek yogurt"".

Orzo is a caffeine-free roasted grain beverage made from ground barley (<i>orzo</i> in Italian, from Latin <i>hordeum</i>). It is an espresso-style drink, and when prepared from the roasted barley directly, it can easily be made in typical espresso machines and coffeemakers. In Italy it is widely available in coffee vending machines. Although traditionally considered a coffee substitute for children, it is an increasingly common choice in Italy and other places for those who choose to eschew caffeine for health reasons. </p><p>In Italy caffè d'orzo is made in traditional Italian espresso machines in cafes. Italian families tend, instead, to make it using an orziera, a special moka pot adapted to barley. </p><p>During World War II and in post-war times, caffè d'orzo and chicory became the most popular drinks in Europe. They were both used as substitutes for coffee, which was expensive and hard to find. In European countries with a very long post-war period, like for instance Spain, this image of barley as a cheap surrogate of coffee still remains in the memory of the population. Thus, from having dozens of Spanish producers in the 1950s and being a widely popular drink in the Spanish Mediterranean coast, now Spain only has two roasters of barley. In Italy, instead, there are dozens of roasters making caffè d'orzo and it is a very popular drink. Outside of Italy the consumption of caffè d'orzo as a healthy drink is also increasing slowly, especially in Germany. </p><p>A variety called <i>café de cebada</i> (""coffee of barley"") in Spanish and simply <i>Cevada</i> in Portuguese is available in Latin American markets, though it is often more of a roasted barley tea than a coffee-like beverage. Instant roasted barley drinks are sold under various brand names (although most of them are made with a mix of cereals, not only barley) such as Caro (Europe, New Zealand), Pero (Switzerland, US) and Barleycup (UK), among others.

Kvikk Lunsj	"<p><i><b>Kvikk Lunsj</b></i> (Norwegian: <i>Quick Lunch</i>) is the name of a chocolate bar that was launched by the Norwegian chocolate sweets manufacturing company, Freia, in 1937 and has been sold ever since — with the exception of a period during and after WWII. Between 1941 and 1949, production was halted due to a shortage of sugar and the lack of quality flour. The chocolate consists of four rectangular wafers covered in milk chocolate, with thinner layers of filler made from ground up discarded wafers and bars mixed with chocolate that is put between wafers in order to break the chocolate into pieces easier. The chocolate has been advertised as a ""hiking chocolate"", and it is often associated with skiing trips in Norwegian culture, especially during Easter vacation, where chocolate is often used to provide extra energy in packed lunches. Kvikk Lunsj is today owned and produced by Mondelez International and sold in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. </p><p>In the course of one year, the average Norwegian eats nine Kvikk Lunsj chocolates. Three of these are on average consumed during Easter. 50 million bars are produced each year, of which between 400 and 500 tons are sold during Easter. A sizable proportion of sales are made in duty-free shops in Sweden and Denmark. </p><p>For many, Kvikk Lunsj has become a symbol of Norwegian culture, and there were therefore strong reactions when Freia replaced the packaging foil with an airtight packaging in 2005, in line with Freia's other chocolates. The packaging had been largely unchanged since 1938, and when the packaging was replaced, Facebook groups were created to show opposition.

Sardar Udham	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Sardar Udham</b></i> is a 2021 Indian Hindi-language biographical historical drama film directed by Shoojit Sircar, and produced by Rising Sun Films in collaboration with Kino Works. The screenplay is written by Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Ritesh Shah, with Bhattacharya also writing the story, and Shah also writing the dialogues, while playing a supporting role. Based on the life of Udham Singh, a freedom fighter from Punjab who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, the film starred Vicky Kaushal in the titular role, along with Shaun Scott, Stephen Hogan, Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu and Kirsty Averton in supporting roles. </p><p>Shoojit Sircar pitched the idea of Udham Singh's biopic during his college days, and planned to produce the film in his mid-1990s, but the research work on the freedom fighter took him two long decades. It was eventually supposed to be made with Irrfan Khan in the titular role, but was latter offered to Kaushal as Khan stepped out due to health conditions. The film was officially announced in March 2019, with principal photography began on April. In a marathon schedule of 6–7 months, spanning four climatic seasons, the makers completed the shooting of the film during December 2019. The makers shot the film in major portions of Russia and India, while also filming few sequences in United Kingdom and Ireland.</p><p><i>Sardar Udham</i> features musical score composed by Shantanu Moitra, cinematography handled by Avik Mukhopadhyay and editing done by Chandrashekhar Prajapati. Initially being delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the makers headed for a direct-to-digital premiere through the streaming service Amazon Prime Video, surpassing theatrical release. The film released on 16 October 2021, during the Dusshera weekend and eventually received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed on Kaushal's performance, direction, screenplay, cinematography, dialogues and technical aspects, but it received some criticism aimed at the film's lengthy runtime. The film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, being depicted in an extended and graphic sequence. <i>Forbes</i> named <i>Sardar Udham</i> 2021’s Best Hindi film with a social message.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1450 Cached time: 20220514225119 Cache expiry: 3600 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.250 seconds Real time usage: 0.338 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1137/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 20774/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2852/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 23/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 6415/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.138/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3838676/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 316.993 1 -total 36.15% 114.580 1 Template:Infobox_film 30.15% 95.558 1 Template:Infobox 27.35% 86.692 3 Template:Cite_news 24.52% 77.725 1 Template:Short_description 12.04% 38.166 1 Template:Pagetype 11.74% 37.205 8 Template:Main_other 6.98% 22.113 1 Template:Use_dmy_dates 6.39% 20.258 7 Template:If_empty 5.36% 16.989 1 Template:SDcat -->"	sardar udham is a 2021 indian hindilanguage biographical historical drama film directed by shoojit sircar and produced by rising sun films in collaboration with kino works the screenplay is written by shubhendu bhattacharya and ritesh shah with bhattacharya also writing the story and shah also writing the dialogues while playing a supporting role based on the life of udham singh a freedom fighter from punjab who assassinated michael odwyer in london to avenge the 1919 jallianwala bagh massacre in amritsar the film starred vicky kaushal in the titular role along with shaun scott stephen hogan amol parashar banita sandhu and kirsty averton in supporting roles shoojit sircar pitched the idea of udham singhs biopic during his college days and planned to produce the film in his mid1990s but the research work on the freedom fighter took him two long decades it was eventually supposed to be made with irrfan khan in the titular role but was latter offered to kaushal as khan stepped out due to health conditions the film was officially announced in march 2019 with principal photography began on april in a marathon schedule of 6–7 months spanning four climatic seasons the makers completed the shooting of the film during december 2019 the makers shot the film in major portions of russia and india while also filming few sequences in united kingdom and irelandsardar udham features musical score composed by shantanu moitra cinematography handled by avik mukhopadhyay and editing done by chandrashekhar prajapati initially being delayed multiple times due to the covid19 pandemic lockdown the makers headed for a directtodigital premiere through the streaming service amazon prime video surpassing theatrical release the film released on 16 october 2021 during the dusshera weekend and eventually received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed on kaushals performance direction screenplay cinematography dialogues and technical aspects but it received some criticism aimed at the films lengthy runtime the film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the jallianwala bagh massacre being depicted in an extended and graphic sequence forbes named sardar udham 2021 ’ s best hindi film with a social message	Hindi language film	hindi language film	Monuments_and_memorials

The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations. </p><p>While many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties. </p> <p>Markers in Manila were first to be installed, following the establishment of the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee (PHRMC), the earliest predecessor of the NHCP. These were markers installed in 1934 for Church of San Agustin, Fort Santiago, Plaza McKinley, Roman Catholic Cathedral of Manila, San Sebastian Church, Concordia College, Manila Railroad Company, Dr. Lorenzo Negrao, and University of Santo Tomas (Intramuros site). The installation of markers were first limited to identify antiquities in Manila. Many markers were destroyed or lost due to World War II, along with the structures they represent, and many have been replaced by post-war markers. </p><p>In 2002, during the unveiling ceremony of the marker National Federation of Women's Club in the Philippines in Manila Hotel, former president Fidel Ramos joked that the curtain raising reminded him of striptease, and everybody laughed. That was the last time that the curtains were pulled upward, and from then, the unveiling has involved curtain pulling instead.</p><p>Following the move to relocate the marker of the first shot of the Filipino-American War from San Juan Bridge to the corner of Sociego and Silencio, Santa Mesa, Manila, former NHI Chairperson Ambeth Ocampo was declared <i>persona non grata</i> in San Juan.

The 1946 marker was replaced on January 27, 2010 when governor Carlos Padilla of Nueva Vizcaya asked why his father, Constancio Padilla was missing from the list of the legislators. Luis Taruc, Jesus Lava, and Amado Yuson of the Democratic Alliance were not in the marker even though they appeared in the Congressional Records, while Luis Clarin, Carlos Fortich, and Narciso Ramos were in the 1946 marker, but not in the present Congressional Records. The Taruc, Lava, and Yuzon were dismissed from Congress, although the latter moved to the Nacionalista Party. Fortich died before completing his term and was replaced by his widow, Remedios Ozamis Fortich. Ramos won as the congressman for the 5th district of Pangasinan, but was appointed soon after to the United Nations, and was replaced by Cipriano Allas.</p><p>The historical marker (installed in 1939) of the Jesuit institution La Ignaciana in Santa Ana, Manila was stolen.

DPWH, however, stated that it informed the local government unit and temporarily removed the statue to protect it from the construction. The department also said that it has allotted ₱39 million for the restoration of the park after the project has been completed in 2020.</p><p>A statue and marker (entitled <i>Filipina Comfort Women</i> Statue and ""Memorare,"" respectively), remembering the comfort women of World War II, installed on December 8, 2017 along Baywalk, Roxas Boulevard, Malate, Manila, caught the attention from the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Embassy in Manila. In response, Teresita Ang-See, said that the memorial should not become an insult versus Japan. On April 27, 2018, the DPWH removed the memorial for a drainage improvement project along the Baywalk. Many individuals and groups, including Gabriela Women's Party condemned the removal, stating historical revisionism and submission to Japanese policy. They also stated that this has been an unlawful removal, since the heritage act protects markers and memorials by the NHCP.

Tombstone of Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera	"<p><b>Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera</b> (<span></span>; c. 22 BC – AD 40) was a Roman-Phoenician soldier born in Sidon, whose tombstone was found in Bingerbrück, Germany, in 1859. A historical connection from this soldier to Jesus has long been hypothesized by numerous scholars, based on the claim of the ancient Greek philosopher Celsus, who, according to Christian writer Origen in his ""Against Celsus"" (Greek Κατὰ Κέλσου, <i>Kata Kelsou</i>; Latin <i>Contra Celsum</i>), was the author of a work entitled <i>The True Word</i> (Greek Λόγος Ἀληθής, <i>Logos Alēthēs</i>). </p><p>Celsus' work was lost but, in Origen's account of it, Jesus was depicted as the result of an affair between his mother Mary and a Roman soldier. He said she was ""convicted of adultery and had a child by a certain soldier named Panthera"". According to James Tabor, Tiberius Pantera could have been serving in the region at the time of Jesus's conception. Both the ancient Talmud and medieval Jewish writings and sayings reinforced this notion, referring to ""Yeshu ben Pantera"", which translates as ""Jesus, son of Pantera"". Tabor's hypothesis is considered highly unlikely by mainstream scholars given that there is little other evidence to support Pantera's paternity outside of the Greek and Jewish texts.</p><p>Historically, the name Pantera is not unusual and was in use among Roman soldiers.</p>"	tiberius julius abdes pantera c 22 bc – ad 40 was a romanphoenician soldier born in sidon whose tombstone was found in bingerbrück germany in 1859 a historical connection from this soldier to jesus has long been hypothesized by numerous scholars based on the claim of the ancient greek philosopher celsus who according to christian writer origen in his against celsus greek κατὰ κέλσου kata kelsou latin contra celsum was the author of a work entitled the true word greek λόγος ἀληθής logos alēthēs celsus work was lost but in origens account of it jesus was depicted as the result of an affair between his mother mary and a roman soldier he said she was convicted of adultery and had a child by a certain soldier named panthera according to james tabor tiberius pantera could have been serving in the region at the time of jesuss conception both the ancient talmud and medieval jewish writings and sayings reinforced this notion referring to yeshu ben pantera which translates as jesus son of pantera tabors hypothesis is considered highly unlikely by mainstream scholars given that there is little other evidence to support panteras paternity outside of the greek and jewish textshistorically the name pantera is not unusual and was in use among roman soldiers	Roman soldier of the Cohors I Sagittariorum (c. 22 BC - AD 40)	roman soldier of the cohors i sagittariorum c 22 bc ad 40	Monuments_and_memorials

Linné (crater)	<p><b>Linné</b> is a small lunar impact crater located in the western Mare Serenitatis. It was named after Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. The mare around this feature is virtually devoid of other features of interest. The nearest named crater is Banting to the east-southeast. The estimated age of this copernican crater is only a few tens of millions of years. It was earlier believed to have a bowl shape, but data from the LRO showed that it has a shape of a flattened, inverted cone. The crater is surrounded by a blanket of ejecta formed during the original impact. This ejecta has a relatively high albedo, making the feature appear bright. </p> <p>In 1824 Wilhelm Lohrmann (1786-1840) of Dresden had drawn Linné as an 8 km diameter crater in his acclaimed lunar atlas, and in 1837 Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler had described Linne in <i>Der Mond</i> as a 10 km crater. In 1866, the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt made the surprising claim that Linné had changed its appearance. Instead of a normal, somewhat deep crater it had become a mere white patch. A controversy arose that continued for many decades. However, this crater size tests the limit of visual perception of Earth-based telescopes. In conditions of poor seeing this feature can appear to vanish from sight (see also transient lunar phenomenon). </p>	linné is a small lunar impact crater located in the western mare serenitatis it was named after swedish botanist carl linnaeus the mare around this feature is virtually devoid of other features of interest the nearest named crater is banting to the eastsoutheast the estimated age of this copernican crater is only a few tens of millions of years it was earlier believed to have a bowl shape but data from the lro showed that it has a shape of a flattened inverted cone the crater is surrounded by a blanket of ejecta formed during the original impact this ejecta has a relatively high albedo making the feature appear bright in 1824 wilhelm lohrmann 17861840 of dresden had drawn linné as an 8 km diameter crater in his acclaimed lunar atlas and in 1837 wilhelm beer and johann heinrich mädler had described linne in der mond as a 10 km crater in 1866 the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker johann friedrich julius schmidt made the surprising claim that linné had changed its appearance instead of a normal somewhat deep crater it had become a mere white patch a controversy arose that continued for many decades however this crater size tests the limit of visual perception of earthbased telescopes in conditions of poor seeing this feature can appear to vanish from sight see also transient lunar phenomenon	lunar crater	lunar crater	Monuments_and_memorials

High cross	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>high cross</b> or <b>standing cross</b> (Irish: <i lang=""ga"">cros ard / ardchros</i>, Scottish Gaelic: <i lang=""gd"">crois àrd / àrd-chrois</i>, Welsh: <i lang=""cy"">croes uchel / croes eglwysig</i>) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated. There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain. </p><p>Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork, interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls, all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork. They were probably normally painted, perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs, in particular scenes crowded with small figures, are often now rather indistinct and hard to read. </p><p>The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth. It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high. Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures. The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross; this seems to be an innovation of Celtic Christianity, perhaps at Iona. Although the earliest example of this form has been found on fifth-seventh century Coptic textile. The term ""high cross"" is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations. </p><p>Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as ""preaching crosses"" at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations. They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period. In the 19th century Celtic Revival Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world.

Ohthere's Mound	"<p><b>Ohthere</b> (also <i>Ohtere</i>), Old Norse <i>Óttarr vendilkráka</i> (<i>Vendelcrow</i>; in Modern Swedish <i>Ottar Vendelkråka</i>) was a semi-legendary king of Sweden of the house of Scylfings, who is said to have lived during the Germanic Heroic Age, possibly during the early 6th century (fl. c. 515 – c. 530). </p><p>His name can be reconstructed as Proto-Norse *<i>Ōhta-harjaz</i> or *<i>Ōhtu-harjaz</i>.

Pazyryk burials	"<p>The <b>Pazyryk</b> <b>burials</b> are a number of Scythian (Saka) Iron Age tombs found in the Pazyryk Valley and the Ukok plateau in the Altai Mountains, Siberia, south of the modern city of Novosibirsk, Russia; the site is close to the borders with China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.</p> <p>Numerous comparable burials have been found in neighbouring western Mongolia. </p><p>The tombs are Scythian-type kurgans, barrow-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large cairns of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th–3rd centuries BCE. The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term <i>kurgan</i>, a Russian word , into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the type site of the wider Pazyryk culture. The site is included in the Golden Mountains of Altai UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p>The bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth is evident in the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation. </p><p>Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekt, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them. Certain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in Scythian art.</p><p>""At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons (masks) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Cimmerian Bosporus.""</p>"	the pazyryk burials are a number of scythian saka iron age tombs found in the pazyryk valley and the ukok plateau in the altai mountains siberia south of the modern city of novosibirsk russia the site is close to the borders with china kazakhstan and mongolia numerous comparable burials have been found in neighbouring western mongolia the tombs are scythiantype kurgans barrowlike tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large cairns of boulders and stones dated to the 4th–3rd centuries bce the spectacular burials at pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term kurgan a russian word into general usage to describe these tombs the region of the pazyryk kurgans is considered the type site of the wider pazyryk culture the site is included in the golden mountains of altai unesco world heritage sitethe bearers of the pazyryk culture were horseriding pastoral nomads of the steppe and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in persia india and china this wealth is evident in the wide array of finds from the pazyryk tombs which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings chinese silk the earliest known pile carpet horses decked out in elaborate trappings and wooden furniture and other household goods these finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze encasing the burial goods in ice which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation because of a freak climatic freeze some of the altaisayan burials notably those of the 5th century bce at pazyryk and neighbouring sites such as katanda shibe and tuekt were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them certain geometric designs and sun symbols such as the circle and rosette recur at pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs such specifically scythian features as zoomorphic junctures ie the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another are rarer in the altaic region than in southern russia the stag and its relatives however figure as prominently in altaisayan as in scythian artat pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons masks of welldefined grecoroman origin which were doubtless inspired by the hellenistic kingdoms of the cimmerian bosporus	Iron Age tombs in the Altai Mountains	iron age tombs in the altai mountains	Monuments_and_memorials

Uncovered in 1830, the stone tomb yielded a wealth of precious artifacts which drew considerable public interest to Scythian world. Of particular interest is an intricately granulated earring with two Nike figurines, now in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.[1] </p><p>The tomb was built around 400 to 350 BC, likely by a team of Greek masons from Panticapaeum. Its Plan is almost square, measuring 4.6 by 4.2 meters (15 by 14 ft). The stepped vault stands 5.3 meters (17 ft) high. The timber ceiling seems to have been designed to imitate a Scythian wooden tent; it is decorated by a canopy with gold plaques. </p><p>The body of the king lay by the east wall on a sumptuous wooden couch. His social position was highlighted by a diadem encircling his head, surmounted by a pointed felt headgear with gold pendants. His neck was decorated by a large gold disk weighing 461 grams. Each wrist was adorned with one to three bracelets. A separate section of the couch contained other grave goods, including a phial, a whip, a knife, and a quiver - all inlaid with gold or precious stones. </p><p>To the left of the couch stood a sarcophagus made of cypress wood and ivory. A woman, probably the king's wife or concubine, lay there. Apart from the brocaded dress, her body was decorated with an electrum diadem with large gold pendants, a pair of open-work earrings, a gold disk, a gold necklace, and two gold bracelets. At her side was placed a bronze hand-held mirror with the gilded handle. An electrum cup, placed between her feet, depicts scenes from Scythian mythology (<i>illustrated, to the right</i>). </p><p>The remains of a slave (probably a charioteer) were discovered by the south wall. A special niche in the wall contained horse bones, a helmet, a bronze sheath, and two spearheads. Several silver bowls and bronze cauldrons containing lamb bones were placed along the walls of the tomb. Inside the amphorae were residual traces of dried wine. A number of bronze arrow-heads were scattered around the floor. </p><p>The archaeologists in charge of the dig did not suspect there was a secret room underneath the tomb.

I Have a Dream (oratorio)	"<p><i><b>I Have a Dream</b></i> is an oratorio by James Furman written in tribute to the composer's friend, Martin Luther King, Jr., to whose memory it is dedicated. The title of the work is derived from the ""I Have a Dream"" speech that Martin Luther King, Jr. made in Washington, D.C. during the August 1963 civil rights march, and the libretto is based on statements and writings by King. </p><p>Furman described <i>I Have a Dream</i> as ""an oratorio in symphonic form which conveys some of the basic concerns of today's world. These concerns are dramatized within a thirty-five minute musical journey focusing upon human dignity, love, hate, the tragedy of war, peace, beauty, poverty, and the hope for genuine freedom."" The composer points out that ""each group, representing a segment of society, speaks as an individual and in conjunction with other groups.""</p><p>The work is in three parts. The musical style is varied, ranging from jungle rhythms to passages of contemporary serial and rock music. Igbo phrases are chanted in the final section of Part I and combined with English words in the coda of Part III.

When he began his first political activities, it was to represent his father during meetings of the Ibadan Peoples Party. From there Adelakun joined the Action Group, it was an arduous task for the party to gain support in Ibadan due to the popularity of a single man, Adegoke Adelabu, even after Adelabu's death AG did not gain much support in Ibadan and violence that sprung out after the death of Adelabu targeted many of the party's members. A schism in AG between the regional Premier, Akintola and former premier, Awolowo emerged in 1962. Adelakun sided the Awolowo faction. Thereafter, Adelakun's faction was weakened in Ibadan during a chaotic period in the Western region.

The court accepted his plea and after the new election was conducted, Adelakun was declared winner. In 1979, Adelakun teamed up with another party leader, Archdeacon Emmanuel Alayande to help UPN clinch majority of votes in Ibadan, it was one of the few times an Awolowo led party was able to win majority votes in the city.

Seattle SuperSonics	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Seattle SuperSonics</b> (commonly known as the <b>Seattle Sonics</b>) were an American professional basketball team based in Seattle. The SuperSonics competed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Western Conference Pacific and Northwest divisions from 1967 until 2008. After the 2007–08 season ended, the team relocated to Oklahoma City, where they now play as the <b>Oklahoma City Thunder</b>. </p><p>Sam Schulman owned the team from its 1967 inception until 1983. It was then owned by Barry Ackerley until 2001, when it came under ownership of the Basketball Club of Seattle, headed by Starbucks chairman emeritus, former president and CEO Howard Schultz. On July 18, 2006, the Basketball Club of Seattle sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise Seattle Storm to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett. The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on October 24, 2006, and finalized seven days later, at which point the new ownership group took control. After failing to find public funding to construct a new arena in the Seattle area, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City before the 2008–09 season, following a $45 million settlement with the city of Seattle to pay off their existing lease at the KeyArena at Seattle Center in advance of its 2010 expiration.</p><p>Home games were played at the KeyArena (originally the Seattle Center Coliseum) for 33 of the franchise's 41 seasons in Seattle. In 1978, the team moved to the Kingdome, which they shared with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). They returned to the Coliseum in 1985, moving temporarily to the Tacoma Dome for the 1994–95 season while the Coliseum was renovated and renamed the KeyArena. </p><p>The SuperSonics won the NBA championship in 1979.

Seattle Reign (basketball)	"<p>The <b>Seattle Reign</b> was the first women's professional basketball franchise in Seattle, Washington, USA. The Reign was a charter member of the American Basketball League (ABL). The team played from 1996 through 1998. The team's name was a reference to the city's reputation for rain and its location in King County, with an additional allusion to ""The Reign Man"" Shawn Kemp, then the city's biggest basketball star. </p><p>The Reign played most of its home games in the Mercer Arena, part of Seattle Center, but occasionally the team played at the larger KeyArena, home of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. The Arena was an old-fashioned, intimate setting for a basketball game, but its seating capacity of about 5,000 limited the team's upside attendance potential. </p><p>In the team's inaugural season, the Reign drafted 1996 Olympic team veteran Venus Lacy to play center, but Lacy was generally outshone by the team's other two ""big women"", Cindy Brown and Tari Phillips. (This was the case even before February 4, 1997, when Lacy was lost for the season due to a severe car injury.) The starting point guard for most games was Christy Hedgpeth, and Kate Paye was the shooting guard. Another player of note was Angela Aycock. </p><p>In the team's second season, with some fanfare, the team drafted Stanford small forward Kate Starbird, who had been a local prep star at Tacoma's Lakes High School. An even bigger impact player proved to be the University of Alabama's Shalonda Enis, who was named the ABL's Rookie of the Year for the 1997–98 season. </p><p>From 1997 on, the ABL faced serious competition from the deeper-pocketed WNBA. Fifteen games into the Reign's third season, on December 22, 1998 the ABL suddenly reached a financial crisis and folded its operations. The Reign was in the midst of its only winning season, and had only weeks before scored their most memorable victory, a double-overtime win before an enthusiastic crowd of 7,400 at the KeyArena, over the San Jose Lasers, led by Jennifer Azzi.</p><p>Unlike most localities that had an ABL team, Seattle was quickly awarded a WNBA franchise two years later. The Seattle Storm debuted in 2000, and won the WNBA Championship four years later in 2004 (they have since won three more WNBA titles). </p>"	the seattle reign was the first womens professional basketball franchise in seattle washington usa the reign was a charter member of the american basketball league abl the team played from 1996 through 1998 the teams name was a reference to the citys reputation for rain and its location in king county with an additional allusion to the reign man shawn kemp then the citys biggest basketball star the reign played most of its home games in the mercer arena part of seattle center but occasionally the team played at the larger keyarena home of the nbas seattle supersonics the arena was an oldfashioned intimate setting for a basketball game but its seating capacity of about 5000 limited the teams upside attendance potential in the teams inaugural season the reign drafted 1996 olympic team veteran venus lacy to play center but lacy was generally outshone by the teams other two big women cindy brown and tari phillips this was the case even before february 4 1997 when lacy was lost for the season due to a severe car injury the starting point guard for most games was christy hedgpeth and kate paye was the shooting guard another player of note was angela aycock in the teams second season with some fanfare the team drafted stanford small forward kate starbird who had been a local prep star at tacomas lakes high school an even bigger impact player proved to be the university of alabamas shalonda enis who was named the abls rookie of the year for the 1997–98 season from 1997 on the abl faced serious competition from the deeperpocketed wnba fifteen games into the reigns third season on december 22 1998 the abl suddenly reached a financial crisis and folded its operations the reign was in the midst of its only winning season and had only weeks before scored their most memorable victory a doubleovertime win before an enthusiastic crowd of 7400 at the keyarena over the san jose lasers led by jennifer azziunlike most localities that had an abl team seattle was quickly awarded a wnba franchise two years later the seattle storm debuted in 2000 and won the wnba championship four years later in 2004 they have since won three more wnba titles	defunct American Basketball League franchise in Seattle, Washington, USA	defunct american basketball league franchise in seattle washington usa	Sports_teams

List of Birmingham City F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Birmingham City Football Club, an association football club based in Birmingham, England, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For the first thirteen years of their existence, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. Small Heath first entered the FA Cup in the 1881–82 season, and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.</p><p>In 1888, the club became a limited company under the name of Small Heath F.C. Ltd, and joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. However, the Combination was not well organised and folded in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding. Small Heath were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889–90, and three years later were elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. They topped the table in their first season, failing to win promotion via the test match system then in operation, but reached the top flight for the first time in 1894. They were renamed Birmingham in 1905, finally becoming Birmingham City in 1943.</p><p>The club's official history rated 1955–56 as their best season to date. The newly promoted club achieved their highest ever finishing position of sixth in the First Division, reached the 1956 FA Cup Final, and became the first English club side to participate in European competition when they played their opening game in the group stages of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Their only major trophy is the League Cup, which they won in 1963 and 2011; they reached the FA Cup final twice and the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup twice. During the 1990s, they twice won the Associate Members' Cup, a competition open to clubs in the third and fourth tiers of English football. </p><p>As of the end of the 2021–22 season, the club's first team had spent 57 seasons in the top division of English football, 58 in the second, and 4 in the third.

List of Darlington F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Darlington Football Club, an English association football club based in Darlington, County Durham, was founded in 1883. In their second season, they won the major regional trophy, the Durham Challenge Cup, and the following season they entered the FA Cup for the first time, only to lose 8–0 to Grimsby Town. In 1889, Darlington were one of the founder members of the Northern League; they won the league title in 1896 and 1900, and reached the semi-final of the FA Amateur Cup in the same two seasons. The club turned professional in 1908 and joined the North-Eastern League. The 1910–11 season saw Darlington reach the last 16 of the FA Cup, progressing through five qualifying rounds to lose to Swindon Town in the third round proper. They won the North-Eastern League in 1913 and 1921, and were invited to join the newly formed Football League Third Division North.</p><p>Runners-up in their first season in the Football League, Darlington were Third Division North champions three years later, thus winning promotion to the Second Division. Their 15th-place finish in 1926 remains, as of 2021, their best League performance; they were relegated back to the Third Division in 1927, where they remained until the Second World War put an end to competitive football. They came third in 1929–30, but twice had to apply for re-election to the League, in 1932–33 and 1936–37, after finishing in last place in the section. In 1934, they enjoyed their first success in a nationally organised cup competition, defeating Stockport County 4–3 at Old Trafford to win the Football League Third Division North Cup, and reached the final again two years later. In the 1957–58 season, the club equalled their previous best FA Cup run, reaching the last 16 by defeating Chelsea, Football League champions only three years earlier, in the fourth round. When the regional sections of the Third Division were merged in 1958–59 to form two national divisions, Darlington were placed in the fourth tier.</p><p>Darlington won promotion to the Third Division in 1965–66, but for one season only. Their most successful season in the League Cup came in 1967–68: drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County in the quarter-final, they took the lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for re-election to the League five times. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division in the 1980s; their 13th-place finish in 1986 was a record high since the introduction of the four-division structure. Darlington were relegated from the Football League in 1988–89 after 68 years of continuous membership. They made an immediate return as Conference champions, then won the Fourth Division title in 1990–91, but spent only one season in the third tier before relegation followed.</p><p>Darlington lost in both the second and the third rounds of the 1999–2000 FA Cup. Manchester United's decision to play in the FIFA Club World Championship rather than the FA Cup left a space in the third round which the organisers filled by drawing lots from among the 20 teams eliminated in the second. Darlington were the ""lucky losers"", and were beaten 2–1 by Aston Villa in the third round after losing 3–1 to Gillingham in the second. They came close to a return to the Third Division via the play-offs in 1996 and 2000, and a period of administration in 2008–09 resulted in a 10-point deduction, without which they would again have reached the play-offs. The following season they were relegated to the Conference for the second time, and went on to reach the 2011 FA Trophy Final, in which Chris Senior scored the only goal of the game in the last minute of extra time to defeat Mansfield Town.</p><p>In 2011–12, another period of administration forced the termination of players' contracts before a last-minute injection of funding enabled Darlington to complete the season. The new owners' failure to secure a Company Voluntary Arrangement before exiting administration meant the Football Association treated the club as a new club, placed it in the Northern League, required a change of playing name – Darlington 1883 was chosen – and barred it from entry to national competitions. The new club won the 2012–13 Northern League title by a 13-point margin to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North for 2013–14, followed two years later by consecutive promotions: first to the Premier Division via the play-offs, then to the National League North as 2015–16 Northern Premier League champions.

List of Portsmouth F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>This is a list of seasons played by Portsmouth Football Club in English and European football, from 1899 (the year of the club's first FA Cup entry and elected straight into the first division of the Southern League) to the most recent completed season. Football was played in the city of Portsmouth from the 1850s and was popular for sailors and dockers to play in the city. The current club was founded in 1898 with John Brickwood, owner of the local brewery, as chairman, and Frank Brettell as the club's first manager. </p><p>A common myth is that the club's first goalkeeper was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. While Conan Doyle did play as <i>AC Smith</i> for an amateur side, Portsmouth Athletic Football Club, that flourished from 1882 to 1894, the first goalkeeper of the professional era was Matt Reilly who previously played for the successful Royal Artillery team. </p><p>Portsmouth was formed to replace the defunct Royal Artillery Portsmouth club, and elected straight into the first division of the Southern League. The club's first league match was played at Chatham Town on 2 September 1899 (a 1–0 victory), followed three days later by the first match at Fratton Park against local rivals Southampton. That first season was hugely successful, with the club winning 20 out of 28 league matches, earning them runners-up spot in the Southern League. The league was won for the first time in the 1901–02 season, by which time Brettell had been replaced by club captain Bob Blyth as manager. </p><p>The 1906–07 season was highlighted by the visit of Manchester United to Fratton Park in the FA Cup, which generated a record attendance of 24,329. A 2–2 draw meant a replay in Manchester, and Portsmouth recorded a famous 2–1 win. However, this record attendance was surpassed two seasons later when Sheffield Wednesday visited Fratton for the second round of the new FA Cup. </p><p>1910–11 saw Portsmouth relegated, but with the recruitment of Robert Brown as manager the team were promoted the next season. </p><p>The club has won the League Championship twice, the FA Cup twice, never won the League Cup, the Charity Shield once (shared). </p><p>This list details the club's achievements in all major competitions, and the top scorers for each season. Top scorers in <b>bold</b> were also the top scorers in the English league that season.

List of Port Vale F.C. seasons	"<p> Port Vale Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, playing in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. After becoming one of the more prominent football clubs in Staffordshire, Burslem Port Vale were invited to become founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892. They spent 13 non-consecutive seasons in the division, punctuated by two seasons in the Midland League, before they resigned due to financial difficulties and entered liquidation in 1907. The name of Port Vale continued in the North Staffordshire Federation League, and this new club were successful enough to be reinstated into the Football League in October 1919. They spent 16 non-consecutive seasons in the Second Division, punctuated by them winning the Third Division North title in 1929–30, before dropping back into the third tier for a much longer stay at the end of the 1935–36 campaign. The 1953–54 season saw manager Freddie Steele's ""Iron Curtain"" defence win both a Third Division North title and a semi-final place in the FA Cup. They failed to build on this success however, though went on to finish as champions of the first ever Fourth Division season under Norman Low's stewardship in 1958–59. </p><p>The club had little success throughout the 1960s and 1970s, despite being briefly managed by Stanley Matthews, and in fact were forced to apply for re-election after breaking FA rules on illegal payments in 1968. Gordon Lee guided the club to promotion back to the Third Division the following season, where they would remain until relegation at the end of the 1977–78 campaign. John McGrath steered the club to promotion in 1982–83, though he departed after relegation became inevitable the following season. His assistant, John Rudge, stepped up to become the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, leading the club from 1983 to 1999. Under his leadership Port Vale won promotions in 1985–86, 1988–89 and 1993–94, lifted the League Trophy in 1993 and reached a post-war record finish of eighth in the second tier in the 1996–97 season. After Rudge's reign ended the club entered a decline, slipping into the fourth tier whilst twice entering administration in 2003 and 2012.

They are currently competing in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. The club was founded in 1874, playing challenge matches organised on an ad hoc basis until the 1877 season, when they entered the Welsh Cup for the first time. The club entered two other competitions (The Cheshire Senior Cup in 1879 and the FA Cup in 1882) before finally playing league football in The Combination in 1890, for which they were founding members. They became founding members of the Football League Second Division in 1892, where the club remained for two seasons, and are the only two seasons in the club's history where they have played professionally and in the English Football League. In the 1894 season, they returned to amateur, regional football when they rejoined the Combination. Two season in the Cheshire League followed until the turn of the century, when Northwich joined the Manchester League in 1900, when they finished as runners-up. Two seasons later, for the first time, they won a league trophy as winners of the Manchester League in 1902. They departed the Manchester League in 1912 when they joined the second division of the Lancashire Combination, finishing 4th in the first season, which ensured their promotion to the first division. In 1919, they became founder members of the Cheshire County League, where they remained until the 1968 season, winning the league just once in the 1956–57 season. Following their departure from the Cheshire County League, they became founder members of the Northern Premier League. In 1979, they founded yet another league, the Alliance Premier League (now known as the Football Conference, where they remained until their relegation in the 2004–05 season. During their time in the Conference, they won the FA Trophy in the 1983–84 season, and finished runners-up twice in 1982 and 1995. They returned to the Conference National at their first attempt when they won the Conference North in the 2005–06 season. However, ongoing financial issues in the latter part of the 2000s saw them relegated twice in two season; in 2009 they were relegated back to the Conference North and then again the following season to the Northern Premier League Premier Division, where they are competing for the current season.</p>"	northwich victoria football club are an english football club based in northwich cheshire they are currently competing in the northern premier league premier division the club was founded in 1874 playing challenge matches organised on an ad hoc basis until the 1877 season when they entered the welsh cup for the first time the club entered two other competitions the cheshire senior cup in 1879 and the fa cup in 1882 before finally playing league football in the combination in 1890 for which they were founding members they became founding members of the football league second division in 1892 where the club remained for two seasons and are the only two seasons in the clubs history where they have played professionally and in the english football league in the 1894 season they returned to amateur regional football when they rejoined the combination two season in the cheshire league followed until the turn of the century when northwich joined the manchester league in 1900 when they finished as runnersup two seasons later for the first time they won a league trophy as winners of the manchester league in 1902 they departed the manchester league in 1912 when they joined the second division of the lancashire combination finishing 4th in the first season which ensured their promotion to the first division in 1919 they became founder members of the cheshire county league where they remained until the 1968 season winning the league just once in the 1956–57 season following their departure from the cheshire county league they became founder members of the northern premier league in 1979 they founded yet another league the alliance premier league now known as the football conference where they remained until their relegation in the 2004–05 season during their time in the conference they won the fa trophy in the 1983–84 season and finished runnersup twice in 1982 and 1995 they returned to the conference national at their first attempt when they won the conference north in the 2005–06 season however ongoing financial issues in the latter part of the 2000s saw them relegated twice in two season in 2009 they were relegated back to the conference north and then again the following season to the northern premier league premier division where they are competing for the current season	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams

List of Bury F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Bury Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Bury, which was in Lancashire until 1974 when it was absorbed into Greater Manchester. Founded in 1885, Bury first entered the FA Cup in 1887–88. Drawn to play Blackburn Rovers away from home, they travelled to Ewood Park but scratched before the game; the two teams played a friendly match instead, which Bury lost heavily. The team first contested an FA Cup match in 1891–92: they beat Witton and Heywood Central before losing to Blackpool after a replay in the third qualifying round.</p><p>Bury were founder members of and runners-up in the Lancashire League in 1889–90, and won the championship in their second and third seasons. They were elected to the Football League ahead of the 1893–94 season, won the Second Division title that same season by a nine-point margin, and beat Liverpool, the First Division's bottom club, in the test match to gain promotion. They retained their top-flight status for 17 seasons. During that period Bury twice won the FA Cup. In the 1900 final, they beat Southern League team Southampton by four goals to nil. Three years later, they did not concede a goal in any round as they went on to beat Derby County 6–0, which remains the widest winning margin in an FA Cup final; the ball used in that match is on display at the National Football Museum.</p><p>They returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in the mid-1920s, and achieved their highest ever finish, of fourth place, in 1925–26. Relegated back to the Second in 1929, Bury did not play in the top flight again; the closest they came was a third place in 1936–37. They flirted with relegation all through the 1950s, finally dropping into the Third Division North for the first time in the club's history in that league's last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958. Returning to the Second Division as Third Division champions in 1961, Bury spent seven of the next eight seasons at that level. In 1962–63, they reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup, losing 4–3 on aggregate to eventual winners Birmingham City. By 1971 Bury were in the Fourth Division, only for a three-season spell, but they were to spend the first half of the 1980s at that level.</p><p>Further spells in the third and fourth tiers preceded two successive promotions in the mid-1990s: third place in Division Three – after the Premier League broke away from the Football League in 1992, the divisions were renumbered upwards – followed by the Division Two title in 1996–97 brought Bury to the second tier for the first time in forty years. After two seasons they were relegated, and by 2002, financial problems brought the club into administration and to the brink of folding. A supporters' campaign raised enough money to keep the club afloat, and in recognition of his role within that process, UEFA presented club press officer Gordon Sorfleet with their Best Supporter award for 2002. Bury were relegated at the end of that season, and then yo-yoed between the third and fourth tiers. Promoted to League One in 2019 against a background of increasingly damaging financial and ownership issues, Bury's early fixtures in the 2019–20 season were successively postponed until, on 27 August 2019, after 125 years continuous membership, the club was expelled from the Football League.</p><p>Bury spent 22 seasons in the top tier of the English football league system, 39 in the second, 29 in the third and 24 in the fourth.

List of Chesterfield F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Chesterfield Football Club is an English association football club based in the Derbyshire town of Chesterfield. The current club dates from 1919, but the histories of earlier Chesterfield-based clubs are generally discussed alongside that of the current club. The first Chesterfield F.C. was founded in the mid-1860s and survived until 1881, long before league football existed. The second incarnation, which became known as Chesterfield Town F.C., was formed in 1884. Its first team joined and won the Sheffield &amp; District League in 1891–92, and first entered the FA Cup the following season. Drawn away to Gainsborough Trinity in the first qualifying round, the score stood at 2–2 at full time; Trinity scored twice during extra time, but darkness fell before the agreed half hour was complete, so the match was ordered to be replayed. Chesterfield lost the replay 4–0. They continued in the Sheffield leagues until joining the Midland Football League in 1896. After three top-four finishes, Chesterfield were elected to the Second Division of the Football League for the 1899–1900 season. The team generally struggled in the Football League: they placed fifth in 1904–05, but followed up with four consecutive bottom-three positions. Three times they successfully applied for re-election to the League, but the fourth application failed, and Chesterfield returned to the Midland League in 1909. Despite winning the title that season, they were not accepted back into the Football League, and continued in the Midland League until competitive football was suspended for the duration of the First World War.</p><p>Chesterfield Town went into voluntary liquidation in 1915. A third club, formed to participate in the wartime competitions, failed because of financial irregularities, and when competitive football resumed, Chesterfield Council founded its own club, Chesterfield Municipal. They won the first post-war Midland League title – and were expelled from that season's FA Cup for fielding an ineligible player – but when the football authorities made clear their opposition to municipal ownership of clubs, the council's involvement ceased and the club was renamed Chesterfield F.C. It was a founder member of the Football League Third Division North, spent much of the 1920s in the top half of that division, and won the title in 1930–31. They retained their Second Division status for just two seasons, won a further Third Division North championship in 1936, and remained in the second tier until the interruption for war and for five seasons thereafter. Consistent top-half finishes meant Chesterfield were allocated to the Third Division when the regional sections were amalgamated into Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958, but they lasted only three seasons before making their debut at the lower level.</p><p>Chesterfield were promoted as 1969–70 Fourth Division champions. In 1980–81, they entered and won the last edition of the Anglo-Scottish Cup, defeating Scottish giants Rangers 3–0 in the quarter-finals before beating Notts County in the final. Two years later, they were relegated, and came close to folding, with debts of £400,000 and only seven contracted professionals, before bouncing back to win their second Fourth Division title in 1985. Over the next 30 years, they experienced four relegations and four promotions between third and fourth tiers. Promoted via the play-offs in 1995, they came within a point of the play-offs the following season, and reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1996–97, in which they faced Middlesbrough of the Premier League. With 21 minutes left and Chesterfield leading 2–1, Jonathan Howard shot against the underside of the bar; the ball bounced down and then out, and referee David Elleray ruled, incorrectly, that it had not crossed the line. A minute later, he awarded a penalty to Middlesbrough for a foul that took place outside the penalty area. Middlesbrough scored, and took a 3–2 lead in extra time, but Jamie Hewitt equalised with seconds left. Chesterfield lost the replay 3–0.</p><p>In 2000–01, a nine-point deduction for financial irregularities, initially deemed too lenient by the Football League, failed to prevent Chesterfield's automatic promotion in third place, and the following year the club was taken out of administration into the ownership and control of the Chesterfield Football Supporters' Society. In the second round of the 2008–09 FA Cup, Chesterfield lost to non-league club Droylsden, but were awarded the tie when their opponents were found to have fielded an ineligible player; when Chesterfield did the same in 2014–15, they were only required to replay the tie, and won. They again won the fourth-tier title in 2010–11 and the following season won the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams from the two lower divisions of the Football League, beating Swindon Town 2–0 in the final. Chesterfield won the fourth-tier championship for a league record fourth time in 2013–14, and again reached the Football League Trophy final; this time they lost 3–1 to Peterborough United. Two consecutive bottom-of-the-table finishes took them back to non-league football in 2018.</p><p>Since their first admission to the Football League in 1899, Chesterfield have spent 20 seasons in the second tier of the English football league system, 55 in the third, 25 in the fourth and 11 in non-league football.

List of Crawley Town F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Crawley Town Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Crawley, West Sussex. Founded in 1896 as Crawley F.C., the team played in junior leagues until 1951 when they were admitted to the Sussex County League as part of its attempted expansion. In their second season, they finished bottom of that league's First Division with only 4 points from 26 matches, but regulations prevented any team being relegated until the division reached its full complement of 16 teams. After another last-place finish two seasons later, they were relegated, but a runners-up spot in the Second Division in 1955–56 preceded a move into the Metropolitan &amp; District League.</p><p>In 1958, under its new name of Crawley Town, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time; its team lost in the preliminary round at home to Horsham. It adopted professional status four years later, and entered the Southern League in 1963–64. Crawley gained promotion to that league's Premier Division for the 1969–70 season, but dropped straight back to Division One. When the league expanded to create two regional second-tier divisions, Crawley were placed in the southern division. They remained in the southern half when the creation of the Alliance Premier League as the top non-league division forced another restructure of the Southern League, this time with parallel Midland and Southern Divisions. Crawley's lowly finish in 1981–82 meant they failed to benefit from yet another reorganisation, whereby the top ten teams in each regional division formed a new Premier Division, but two years later they were promoted as runners-up.</p><p>They remained at that level for the next twenty years, until they won their first Southern League title in 2003–04 and consequent promotion to the new Conference National. Despite a variety of points deductions, including ten points in 2006–07 for entering administration and six the following season for financial irregularities, and a transfer embargo, they held on to their Conference status. In 2010–11, they not only progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup, coming ""within inches"" of drawing with Manchester United at Old Trafford via Richard Brodie's header against the crossbar, they were not distracted from the league campaign; a 30-match unbeaten run and a Conference record 105 points earned them the 2010–11 title and promotion to the Football League. As well as reaching the FA Cup fifth round again, they came third in their first season in League Two, so went up to League One, where they remained for three seasons before returning to the fourth tier.</p><p>The table details the team's achievements and the top goalscorer in senior first-team competitions from their first season in the Sussex County League in 1951–52 to the end of the most recently completed season. </p>"	crawley town football club is an english association football club based in the town of crawley west sussex founded in 1896 as crawley fc the team played in junior leagues until 1951 when they were admitted to the sussex county league as part of its attempted expansion in their second season they finished bottom of that leagues first division with only 4 points from 26 matches but regulations prevented any team being relegated until the division reached its full complement of 16 teams after another lastplace finish two seasons later they were relegated but a runnersup spot in the second division in 1955–56 preceded a move into the metropolitan amp district leaguein 1958 under its new name of crawley town the club entered the fa cup for the first time its team lost in the preliminary round at home to horsham it adopted professional status four years later and entered the southern league in 1963–64 crawley gained promotion to that leagues premier division for the 1969–70 season but dropped straight back to division one when the league expanded to create two regional secondtier divisions crawley were placed in the southern division they remained in the southern half when the creation of the alliance premier league as the top nonleague division forced another restructure of the southern league this time with parallel midland and southern divisions crawleys lowly finish in 1981–82 meant they failed to benefit from yet another reorganisation whereby the top ten teams in each regional division formed a new premier division but two years later they were promoted as runnersupthey remained at that level for the next twenty years until they won their first southern league title in 2003–04 and consequent promotion to the new conference national despite a variety of points deductions including ten points in 2006–07 for entering administration and six the following season for financial irregularities and a transfer embargo they held on to their conference status in 2010–11 they not only progressed to the fifth round of the fa cup coming within inches of drawing with manchester united at old trafford via richard brodies header against the crossbar they were not distracted from the league campaign a 30match unbeaten run and a conference record 105 points earned them the 2010–11 title and promotion to the football league as well as reaching the fa cup fifth round again they came third in their first season in league two so went up to league one where they remained for three seasons before returning to the fourth tierthe table details the teams achievements and the top goalscorer in senior firstteam competitions from their first season in the sussex county league in 1951–52 to the end of the most recently completed season	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams
List of Hartlepool United F.C. seasons	<p> Hartlepool United Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Hartlepool, County Durham. The club was founded in 1908, and its first team played in the North-Eastern League from then until 1921, when the Football League formed a new Third Division based in the north of England. Hartlepool have never played above the third tier of English football, nor have they won a divisional title, but they remained a member of the Football League for 89 consecutive seasons before returning to non-league football in 2017. They hold the record for applications for re-election, with fourteen – three to the Third Division North and a divisional record eleven to the Fourth Division – and all fourteen were successful. Their highest league placing was second in the Third Division North in 1956–57 – only the champions were promoted – but a year later, they were placed in the Fourth Division when the regionalised third tiers were merged into nationwide third and fourth tiers. Since that restructure, their highest league finish has been sixth in the third tier, in 2003–04 and 2004–05; on the latter occasion, they reached the play-off final but lost out to Sheffield Wednesday. They were relegated from the Football League for the first time in 2016–17. They reached the last 32 of the FA Cup for the first time in 1954–55, and have matched that performance six times since, most recently in 2021–22. In the Football League Cup, their best performance was to reach the last 16 in 1975–76. </p>	hartlepool united football club is an english association football club based in the town of hartlepool county durham the club was founded in 1908 and its first team played in the northeastern league from then until 1921 when the football league formed a new third division based in the north of england hartlepool have never played above the third tier of english football nor have they won a divisional title but they remained a member of the football league for 89 consecutive seasons before returning to nonleague football in 2017 they hold the record for applications for reelection with fourteen – three to the third division north and a divisional record eleven to the fourth division – and all fourteen were successful their highest league placing was second in the third division north in 1956–57 – only the champions were promoted – but a year later they were placed in the fourth division when the regionalised third tiers were merged into nationwide third and fourth tiers since that restructure their highest league finish has been sixth in the third tier in 2003–04 and 2004–05 on the latter occasion they reached the playoff final but lost out to sheffield wednesday they were relegated from the football league for the first time in 2016–17 they reached the last 32 of the fa cup for the first time in 1954–55 and have matched that performance six times since most recently in 2021–22 in the football league cup their best performance was to reach the last 16 in 1975–76	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams
List of Mansfield Town F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Mansfield Town Football Club is an English association football club based in the Nottinghamshire town of Mansfield. Founded in 1897 as Mansfield Wesleyans, the team first entered the Mansfield &amp; District Amateur League in 1902. Four years later, the club turned professional, tweaked its name to Mansfield Wesley, and joined the Notts &amp; District League. The team made their debut in the FA Cup in 1909–10, and joined the Central Alliance in 1911, by which time the club had adopted its current name of Mansfield Town. In the first post-First World War season, they moved to the Field Mill ground and won the Central Alliance title, and in 1921, they were accepted into the Midland League. Three years later, they won the Midland League title, repeated the feat the following year, and were runners-up the next. Applications for election to the Football League were unsuccessful, but in the hope of a better class of football, they had one season in the Midland Combination, primarily a reserve league for Football League clubs, before returning to the Midland League. In 1928–29, Mansfield won the Midland League title by a nine-point margin and beat two Football League clubs on the way to their first appearance in the fourth round of the FA Cup, in which they lost 2–0 to Arsenal at Highbury.</p><p>Geographically, Mansfield lay on the border between the catchment areas of the Northern and Southern sections of the regionalised Third Division of the League. They had previously applied for election to the Northern Section; for the 1931–32 season, they applied to the Southern Section, and were admitted. After one season, in which they struggled, the team was reallocated to the Northern Section, before returning to the Southern in 1937. Competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Mansfield finished 22nd and bottom in the first post-war season, and thus had to apply for re-election to the League. The management committee decided that in light of the difficult circumstances facing all clubs in resuming competitive professional football after the war, all clubs facing re-election should be accepted unopposed. Mansfield were transferred to the Northern Section for 1947–48. Three seasons later, they finished runners-up – at that time, only the champions were promoted – and reached the fifth round (last 16) of the FA Cup for the first time, losing to First Division team and eventual cup finalists Blackpool. Against a background of financial and governance problems that brought the club close to bankruptcy, Mansfield remained in the Northern Section until the regional sections were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958, when they were placed in the Third Division.</p><p>Two years later, Mansfield were relegated for the first time in their history. In their third season in the fourth tier, they finished fourth and were promoted on goal average, ahead of Gillingham by 0.118 of a goal. After a further nine years in the Third – during which time they reached the 1968–69 FA Cup quarter-final, which remains their best achievement in the competition – and three in the Fourth Divisions, Mansfield won their first title at Football League level, taking the 1974–75 Fourth Division by a six-point margin. A season of consolidation, whose highlights included progressing to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the first of two Anglo-Scottish Cup semi-finals, preceded another championship: the 1976–77 Third Division title gained Mansfield promotion to the Football League Second Division for the first and as yet only time. They could not maintain that status, and for the next thirty years continued to drift between third and fourth tiers, during which time they won the 1986–87 Associate Members' Cup, a cup competition open to teams from the lowest two tiers of the League; Mansfield beat Bristol City in a penalty shoot-out in the final. In 2007–08, they finished 23rd in the fourth tier and were relegated out of the Football League into the Conference National (promotion and relegation between League and Conference had replaced re-election in 1987). They reached the final of the 2010–11 FA Trophy, losing to Darlington in the last minute of extra time, before returning to the League as Conference champions in 2013.</p><p>Since their admission to the Football League, Mansfield Town have spent 1 season in the second tier of the English football league system, 42 in the third, 35 in the fourth, and 5 in the top tier of non-league football.

List of Peterborough United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Peterborough United Football Club is an English association football club based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. After former Southern League club Peterborough &amp; Fletton United folded in 1932, there had been no senior football in the Peterborough area. In the summer of 1934, a new professional club, named Peterborough United, was founded to take its place. It was welcomed into membership of the Midland League for 1934–35, and the club's first team finished that initial season in mid-table. They entered the national cup competition, the FA Cup, the following season, but lost their opening match 3–0 at home to Rushden Town in the first qualifying round. When competitive football resumed after the Second World War, Peterborough enjoyed improved performances in both league and cup competition. In the cup, they regularly reached the rounds proper, and progressed to the fourth round in 1956–57 and 1959–60, eliminating two Football League teams on the first occasion and three on the second. In the Midland League, they finished second in 1953–54, third the following year, and then embarked on a run of five consecutive championships, scoring more than 100 goals in each campaign. Repeated attempts at election to the Football League failed – albeit narrowly in 1958–59 – until they finally gained admission to the Fourth Division in 1960 at the expense of Gateshead.</p><p>Their momentum continued into the new Football League season: in second place with Christmas approaching, Peterborough did not lose again until the following April. They won the Fourth Division title, scoring what remains a Football League record 134 goals. Terry Bly supplied 52 of those 134 – not a league record, but a seasonal total which has not been surpassed since. They followed up with four top-half finishes at the higher level before dropping to mid-table, eliminated Arsenal among others on their way to the sixth round (quarter-final) of the 1964–65 FA Cup, and went one step further in the 1965–66 League Cup, losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semifinal, but problems off the field disrupted their further progress. In November 1967, the Football Association and Football League met to consider charges of making illegal payments to players, poor accounting practices and poor internal governance, stemming from claims surrounding an FA Cup match against Sunderland the previous January. They decided that Peterborough would be demoted to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1967–68 season. At the time, they stood fourth in the Third Division after 19 matches. They won their second Fourth Division championship in 1973–74, this time spending five years in the Third before returning to the fourth tier until 1991.</p><p>Back-to-back promotions – via a fourth-place finish in 1990–91 and the play-offs in 1992, beating Stockport County 2–1 in the final, – earned Peterborough a place in the second tier for the first time in the club's history. They came 10th in what was called the First Division – when the newly formed FA Premier League split from the Football League, the remaining divisions of the Football League were renumbered upwards – which remains the team's highest league finish. and were relegated in 1993–94. They returned to the second tier, which by then had been rebranded as the Football League Championship, in 2009, again after two consecutive promotions. Although relegated straight back to League One, they were immediately re-promoted, and stayed up for two seasons. Failure in the 2014 play-offs was offset by a first ever victory in a nationally organised cup competition: Peterborough defeated Chesterfield by three goals to one in the final of the 2013–14 Football League Trophy, a competition open to clubs in the third and fourth tiers of English football. They returned to the Championship as 2020–21 League One runners-up.</p><p>As of the end of the 2020–21 season, the team have spent 25 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 31 in the third, and 5 in the second.

List of Scunthorpe United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Scunthorpe United Football Club, an English association football club based in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was founded in 1899 as the result of a merger between Brumby Hall F.C. and another club. The team first entered the national cup competition, the FA Cup, in 1909–10; they beat Withernsea 8–0 in the preliminary round before losing 4–0 to York City in the first qualifying round. In 1910, after amalgamating with North Lindsey United, the club took the name Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United, and two years later, it became a member of the Midland League. The first team finished that initial season in the lower reaches of the table, but when competitive football resumed after the First World War, they enjoyed consecutive top-seven finishes, culminating in their first Midland League title in 1926–27, a success fuelled by 52 goals from former England international Ernie Simms. They again won the title in 1938–39, and it seemed for much of the season as if Harry Johnson was sure to overtake Simms' total, but he missed several matches in the later part of the season and had to settle for 49.</p><p>Scunthorpe made their first application to join the Football League ahead of the formation of the Northern Section of the Third Division in 1921; they were not elected, and their bids for election continued to fail until the League's next expansion, in 1950. The voting was tight, but Scunthorpe became one of two Midland League teams to join the Northern Section when each regional third-tier division grew from 22 to 24. They finished the 1950–51 Football League season in mid-table, and seven years later won the Third Division North title – the last season of that league before the regional divisions were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions – by a seven-point margin. They also reached the fifth round (last 16) of the FA Cup for the first time, defeating First Division club Newcastle United and holding Liverpool for 75 minutes before conceding the only goal of the match.</p><p>Ahead of their Second Division debut, the club dropped the Lindsey from its name, becoming plain Scunthorpe United. They spent six seasons at that level, and finished a club record fourth in 1961–62, five points behind the second promotion place. After four seasons in the Third Division, they dropped to the Fourth, in which they remained for the next 36 years, apart from three single-season ventures into the higher level; the last of those, in 1999–2000, came courtesy of their fifth attempt at promotion via the play-offs. The Football League rebranded their divisions ahead of the 2004–05 season, so that the fourth tier became Football League Two, and the change of name coincided with a change of fortune for Scunthorpe. Gaining promotion to League One as runners-up, ahead of Swansea City on goal difference, this time they not only stayed up but went on to win the League One title in 2006–07. Relegated in their first season in the Championship, they came straight back via the play-offs to spend another two seasons in the second tier. In 2008–09, they lost to Luton Town in the final of the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams from the third and fourth tiers of the English football league system, and the following season, they reached the last 16 of the League Cup for the first time. Two relegations in three years returned them to the fourth tier, from which they bounced straight back as 2013–14 runners-up. After twice reaching the play-offs, they were relegated to League Two in 2019. </p><p>As of the end of the 2020–21 season, the team have spent 37 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 25 in the third, and 9 in the second.

List of Southend United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Southend United Football Club, an English association football club based in Southend, Essex, was founded in 1906. The club's first team won the Southern League Second Division championship in their first season. Southend had to apply for election alongside the two bottom First Division teams who were applying for re-election; they were unsuccessful. Southend won the title again the following year, and this time, with more places available after two clubs had joined the Football League, they were elected. By 1910–11, the Southern League had adopted automatic promotion and relegation, and Southend were relegated. They returned to the top tier as runners-up in 1912–13, and remained at that level until 1920, when the Football League added a Third Division made up almost entirely of the Southern League First Division teams. That same season, Southend reached the third round (last 16) of the FA Cup; they have progressed to the last 16 four times since, but have gone no further.</p><p>Southend remained in the Third Division for the next 39 seasons. The closest they came to a change were via two successful application for re-election, in 1921–22, their second season as a Football League club, and then in 1934–35, and two third-place finishes, in 1931–32 and 1949–50, at a time when only the divisional champions were promoted. In 1965–66, they were relegated to the Fourth Division, and spent the next 25 years oscillating between the two. Southend's first trophy in the Football League came in 1980–81, courtesy of a strong defence and a particularly strong home record, as they won the Fourth Division title by a two-point margin. Eight years later, they were again promoted from the fourth tier, this time in third place, and the following season, a final-day defeat deprived Southend of the title but they were still sure of the runners-up spot that gained promotion to the second tier for the first time in the club's history. Southend spent six seasons at the higher level, during which time they lost a penalty shoot-out to Notts County in the semi-final of the 1993–94 Anglo-Italian Cup, before two consecutive relegations took them back whence they came. </p><p>In 2006–07, again after consecutive promotions, they played one more season in the Championship – the Football League's divisions had been rebranded two years earlier – and produced their best League Cup performance, eliminating Manchester United in the fourth round before losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final via an arguably offside goal scored five minutes from the end of extra time. Southend reached the final of the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams in the lower divisions of the Football League, in both 2004 and 2005. Both finals were played at the Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction, and both ended in defeat by two goals to nil, to Blackpool in 2004 and Wrexham the following year. They repeated the procedure in 2013, albeit this time at the new Wembley, losing 2–0 to Crewe Alexandra and equalling Brentford's record of three final appearances without winning. Financial issues mounted in the 2019–20 season: against a background of non-payment of wages, unpaid taxes, winding-up orders and a transfer embargo meant Southend were unable to avoid relegation to League Two, and even when the tax bill was paid after the sale of the stadium for housing, a 23rd-place finish in 2020–21 meant that Southend United dropped out of the League after 101 years' continuous membership.</p><p>As of the end of the 2020–21 season, the team have spent 26 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 61 in the third, and 7 in the second.

List of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Wycombe Wanderers Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Founded in 1887 as an amateur club, the team entered the FA Amateur Cup for the first time in 1894–95, made their FA Cup debut the following season, and joined the Southern League in 1896. They played in the Second Division of the Southern League until 1908, when after twice finishing bottom of that league, the club declined the invitation to continue membership and opted for the amateur Great Western Suburban League instead. When competitive football resumed after the First World War they spent two seasons in the Spartan League – winning the title on each occasion – before being accepted into the Isthmian League, in which they spent the remainder of the inter-war period. They finished third in 1930–31, but the highlight of the season was victory in the Amateur Cup. In the final, held at Arsenal's Highbury Stadium, Wycombe beat Hayes 1–0 to win the trophy for the first and only time. The goal was scored by Alf Britnell after 81 minutes. Between 1953–54 and 1959–60, Wycombe never finished outside the top four in the Isthmian League. They won the championship for the first time in 1955–56, retained the title in 1956–57, and reached the Amateur Cup Final that same year. This time, they lost 3–1 in front of a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium as Bishop Auckland won their third consecutive Amateur Cup.</p><p>At the start of the 1970s, Wycombe won the Isthmian League four times in five seasons. The fourth of those titles, in 1974–75, was in the first season after the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished, so Wycombe made their first appearance in the FA Trophy, which until then had been open to non-League clubs that registered professional players. They also reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time; they held First Division leaders Middlesbrough to a goalless draw at Loakes Park, and only lost the replay to a last-minute goal. Courtesy of the Isthmian League win, they were invited to enter the Anglo-Italian Semi-Professional Trophy, a match played on a home-and-away basis against Monza, winners of the Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti. Wycombe lost the away leg 1–0 but won 2–0 at home to take the trophy.</p><p>Wycombe's continued success in the Isthmian League brought potential promotion to the Alliance Premier League, the level immediately below the Football League. The club twice refused the opportunity before accepting for the 1985–86 season. They finished 20th, and were relegated on goal difference, but thanks to their eighth Isthmian League title, made an immediate return to the higher level, which had been renamed the Football Conference. Under the management of Martin O'Neill, Wycombe won the FA Trophy for the first time in 1991, beating Kidderminster Harriers at Wembley in front of a then record attendance for the competition of 34,842. They followed up with runners-up spot in the 1991–92 season and went one better in 1992–93, adding a second FA Trophy to the Conference title and consequent promotion to the Football League. </p><p>They marked their debut season in the Football League with promotion to the Second Division via the play-offs; after a fourth-place finish, they beat Carlisle United in the semi-final and came from 2–1 down to beat Preston North End 4–2 in the final. After eight seasons in the third tier, they were relegated, and thereafter moved regularly between the two lower tiers. In 2013–14, they avoided a return to the Conference only on goal difference, but bounced back to reach the play-off final the following year, only to lose to Southend United in a penalty shoot-out. In 2017–18, they were promoted back to League One and two years later they reached the second tier of English football for the first time in their history after beating Oxford United 2–1 in the play-off final. Although they lost their first seven matches of the 2020–21 EFL Championship, and were 12 points adrift in mid-February, they recovered to finish 22nd and their relegation was only confirmed on the final day of the season.</p><p>Wycombe reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time in 2000–01; they had not previously passed the third round. They held Liverpool, holders of the 2000–01 League Cup and still in that season's UEFA Cup, for 78 minutes before goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler secured a place in the final for the Premier League club; Keith Ryan made the score 2–1. In the Football League Cup, Wycombe eliminated two Premier League clubs, Fulham and Charlton Athletic, on their way to the 2006–07 semi-final; they drew with Chelsea in the home leg, but lost 4–0 at Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Since their admission to the Football League, Wycombe have spent 13 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 14 in the third tier, and 1 in the second.

List of Watford F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Watford Football Club is an English football club from Watford, Hertfordshire. Formed on 15 April 1898 as a result of the amalgamation of two strong local clubs, Watford St. Mary's and West Herts. West Herts began life as Watford Rovers in 1881, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886. In the same year, they also entered the county-wide Herts Senior Cup, reaching the final six times over the next ten years. Watford Rovers became West Herts in 1891, and joined the Southern League for the 1896–97 season. The team started to change from one composed entirely of amateurs to one including paid professionals. In 1898, West Herts amalgamated with Watford St Mary's to form a new club, Watford Football Club.</p><p>The club participated in the Southern League from 1896 until 1920, experiencing considerable success. They won six league titles in this period, including the Southern League First Division in 1914–15. After the resumption of Southern League football following a four-year hiatus due to the First World War, Watford missed out on a second consecutive title in 1919–20 on goal average. They joined the Football League Third Division in the 1920–21 season, and following its subsequent reorganisation became founder members of the Third Division South in 1921.</p><p>Watford competed in the Third Division South for the next 37 years, with little success. Fred Pagnam finished as the Division's top scorer in 1922–23, the club reached the final of the Third Division South Cup in 1935 and 1937 (winning on the latter occasion), and Len Dunderdale scored 21 goals for Watford in 1938–39 despite leaving midway through the season. The team started to progress after the reorganisation of the Football League into four national divisions in 1958. They won promotion to the Third Division in 1960, the Second Division in 1969, and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1970. However, the league progress was reversed with two relegations over the next five years, and in 1976–77 Watford were briefly bottom of the entire Football League.</p><p>A turning point in the club's history came in the late 1970s. Singer, shareholder and lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became chairman in 1976, and appointed Graham Taylor as manager in 1977. The club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979, and reached the First Division for the first time in their history in 1982. Furthermore, in 1982–83 Watford finished second in the First Division, and Luther Blissett was the division's top scorer with 27 goals. Consequently, Watford qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1983–84. They also reached their first FA Cup final, losing 2–0 to Everton at Wembley Stadium. Following Taylor's departure in 1987, Watford were relegated in 1988.</p><p>Watford remained in English football's second tier for eight seasons, until they were relegated in 1995–96. Taylor returned as manager in 1997, and for the second time in his career led Watford to consecutive promotions, although he was unable to prevent relegation from the Premier League in 1999–2000. In the 21st century Watford have reached three FA Cup semi-finals, one League Cup semi-final, and spent three further season in the Premier League after winning the 2006 Football League Championship play-off final under the management of Aidy Boothroyd and following automatic promotion under Slaviša Jokanović in 2015.</p>"	watford football club is an english football club from watford hertfordshire formed on 15 april 1898 as a result of the amalgamation of two strong local clubs watford st marys and west herts west herts began life as watford rovers in 1881 the club entered the fa cup for the first time in 1886 in the same year they also entered the countywide herts senior cup reaching the final six times over the next ten years watford rovers became west herts in 1891 and joined the southern league for the 1896–97 season the team started to change from one composed entirely of amateurs to one including paid professionals in 1898 west herts amalgamated with watford st marys to form a new club watford football clubthe club participated in the southern league from 1896 until 1920 experiencing considerable success they won six league titles in this period including the southern league first division in 1914–15 after the resumption of southern league football following a fouryear hiatus due to the first world war watford missed out on a second consecutive title in 1919–20 on goal average they joined the football league third division in the 1920–21 season and following its subsequent reorganisation became founder members of the third division south in 1921watford competed in the third division south for the next 37 years with little success fred pagnam finished as the divisions top scorer in 1922–23 the club reached the final of the third division south cup in 1935 and 1937 winning on the latter occasion and len dunderdale scored 21 goals for watford in 1938–39 despite leaving midway through the season the team started to progress after the reorganisation of the football league into four national divisions in 1958 they won promotion to the third division in 1960 the second division in 1969 and reached the fa cup semifinal in 1970 however the league progress was reversed with two relegations over the next five years and in 1976–77 watford were briefly bottom of the entire football leaguea turning point in the clubs history came in the late 1970s singer shareholder and lifelong watford supporter elton john became chairman in 1976 and appointed graham taylor as manager in 1977 the club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979 and reached the first division for the first time in their history in 1982 furthermore in 1982–83 watford finished second in the first division and luther blissett was the divisions top scorer with 27 goals consequently watford qualified for the uefa cup in 1983–84 they also reached their first fa cup final losing 2–0 to everton at wembley stadium following taylors departure in 1987 watford were relegated in 1988watford remained in english footballs second tier for eight seasons until they were relegated in 1995–96 taylor returned as manager in 1997 and for the second time in his career led watford to consecutive promotions although he was unable to prevent relegation from the premier league in 1999–2000 in the 21st century watford have reached three fa cup semifinals one league cup semifinal and spent three further season in the premier league after winning the 2006 football league championship playoff final under the management of aidy boothroyd and following automatic promotion under slaviša jokanović in 2015	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams
List of Everton F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>The following lists Everton's League performances, top goalscorers and average attendances from 1888, when the Football League was formed, to the end of the most recent completed season. For a more detailed history see History of Everton F.C. </p><p>Everton were founder members of the Football League in 1888 and were champions of it for the first time in 1891. By the time World War II broke out in 1939, they had been league champions five times and had fielded some of the biggest names in English football, including goalkeeper Ted Sagar and forwards Dixie Dean and Tommy Lawton. In Everton's title-winning season of 1927–28, Dean scored a record 60 league goals in a single season – which has not been matched in this country since. </p><p>Everton originally played at Anfield until a dispute with their landlord in 1892 saw the club exit the ground, which was re-occupied by the newly formed Liverpool, who gradually became Everton's fierce local rivals. Everton, meanwhile, settled into nearby Goodison Park, where they have played ever since, in spite of a series of plans since the late 1990s to relocate the club to a new stadium. </p><p>Everton have played in the top flight of English football for all but four seasons since the 1888 creation of the Football League, playing at the top level continuously since 1954. Only Arsenal have enjoyed a longer unbroken run at the highest level. </p><p>After World War II, Everton's first major success came in 1963, when the league title was won under the management of Harry Catterick, who added another league title to Everton's honours list in 1970 as well as the FA Cup in 1966. </p><p>Another golden era at Everton prevailed after the appointment of Howard Kendall as manager in 1981. Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and were league champions in 1985, when they also won their first European trophy in the shape of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Another league title followed in 1987. </p><p>Everton's only major trophy since 1987 came in 1995 when they won the FA Cup under the management of Joe Royle, who like Kendall had been with the club during his playing career. Since the formation of the FA Premier League in 1992, their highest league finish was fourth place in 2005 and on one occasion (1998) they finished one place above the relegation zone, only avoiding relegation on goal difference. </p><p>The appointment of David Moyes as manager in 2002 brought something of a turning point in Everton's recent history, as the new manager re-established the club as a regular feature in the top few places of the English league, although he failed to add any silverware, the club being finalists in the 2009 FA Cup Final. Moyes departed in 2013 after 11 years as Everton manager to take charge of Manchester United, being succeeded by Roberto Martinez, who had a promising first season but was sacked after three seasons to be replaced by Ronald Koeman. Koeman was dismissed in October 2017, with the club lying in 18th position in the initial stage of the 2017–18 season. Koeman was replaced by Sam Allardyce with the team eventually finishing 8th in the Premier League. Allardyce had his 18-month contract terminated at the end of the season. </p><p>On 31 May 2018, Everton appointed Marco Silva, as their new manager. Silva had originally been approached to become the clubs' manager in October 2017, following the dismissal of Ronald Koeman. However, at that stage he was still manager of Watford and subsequently any proposed deal at that time fell through. Silva was replaced at Watford in January 2018, after a bad run of results in the Premier League. Evertons' pursuit of Silva resurfaced after the club parted company with Sam Allardyce. </p><p>On 6 December 2019, Silva was dismissed after a poor run of results left the club in the relegation zone. Silva's team had won 24 and lost 24 of their league games under his tenure. On 21 December 2019, Carlo Ancelotti was appointed the club's new manager on a four and a half year contract. However, he would depart the club on 1 June 2021, returning to coach Real Madrid. </p>"	the following lists evertons league performances top goalscorers and average attendances from 1888 when the football league was formed to the end of the most recent completed season for a more detailed history see history of everton fc everton were founder members of the football league in 1888 and were champions of it for the first time in 1891 by the time world war ii broke out in 1939 they had been league champions five times and had fielded some of the biggest names in english football including goalkeeper ted sagar and forwards dixie dean and tommy lawton in evertons titlewinning season of 1927–28 dean scored a record 60 league goals in a single season – which has not been matched in this country since everton originally played at anfield until a dispute with their landlord in 1892 saw the club exit the ground which was reoccupied by the newly formed liverpool who gradually became evertons fierce local rivals everton meanwhile settled into nearby goodison park where they have played ever since in spite of a series of plans since the late 1990s to relocate the club to a new stadium everton have played in the top flight of english football for all but four seasons since the 1888 creation of the football league playing at the top level continuously since 1954 only arsenal have enjoyed a longer unbroken run at the highest level after world war ii evertons first major success came in 1963 when the league title was won under the management of harry catterick who added another league title to evertons honours list in 1970 as well as the fa cup in 1966 another golden era at everton prevailed after the appointment of howard kendall as manager in 1981 everton won the fa cup in 1984 and were league champions in 1985 when they also won their first european trophy in the shape of the european cup winners cup another league title followed in 1987 evertons only major trophy since 1987 came in 1995 when they won the fa cup under the management of joe royle who like kendall had been with the club during his playing career since the formation of the fa premier league in 1992 their highest league finish was fourth place in 2005 and on one occasion 1998 they finished one place above the relegation zone only avoiding relegation on goal difference the appointment of david moyes as manager in 2002 brought something of a turning point in evertons recent history as the new manager reestablished the club as a regular feature in the top few places of the english league although he failed to add any silverware the club being finalists in the 2009 fa cup final moyes departed in 2013 after 11 years as everton manager to take charge of manchester united being succeeded by roberto martinez who had a promising first season but was sacked after three seasons to be replaced by ronald koeman koeman was dismissed in october 2017 with the club lying in 18th position in the initial stage of the 2017–18 season koeman was replaced by sam allardyce with the team eventually finishing 8th in the premier league allardyce had his 18month contract terminated at the end of the season on 31 may 2018 everton appointed marco silva as their new manager silva had originally been approached to become the clubs manager in october 2017 following the dismissal of ronald koeman however at that stage he was still manager of watford and subsequently any proposed deal at that time fell through silva was replaced at watford in january 2018 after a bad run of results in the premier league evertons pursuit of silva resurfaced after the club parted company with sam allardyce on 6 december 2019 silva was dismissed after a poor run of results left the club in the relegation zone silvas team had won 24 and lost 24 of their league games under his tenure on 21 december 2019 carlo ancelotti was appointed the clubs new manager on a four and a half year contract however he would depart the club on 1 june 2021 returning to coach real madrid	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia list article	Sports_teams

Moniek Kleinsman	<p><b>Moniek Kleinsman</b> (born 3 November 1982) is a Dutch speed skater who was born in Bentelo, Overijssel, and currently resides in Wolvega. She competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics.</p><p>Kleinsman got her first speed skating lessons at the age of four. A few years later, when she was getting more serious into the sport she was mainly focussing on short track speed skating, just like her brother. However, at the age of twelve she decided to concentrate on long track speed skating instead. </p><p>After competing among the seniors for a few years her breakthrough came in the 2004–05 season, when she won the Dutch national allround championships. That season she appeared on World Cup meets, became 7th at the European allround championships, followed by an eighth position at the World allround championships. Finally, at the KNSB Dutch Single Distance Championships she won two bronze medals over 3000 and 5000 metres. </p><p>On 28 December 2005 Kleinsman qualified herself for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin at the 3000 metres. It was the third time behind Ireen Wüst and Renate Groenewold. A second try to qualify for the race over 5000 metres fails as she became fourth, however she skated a personal best time that day.</p><p>Prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics Kleinsman became under pressure by the Dutch media as it was unsure whether 2002 Winter Olympics silver medalist Gretha Smit could participate at the Olympic 5000 metres race. Smit finished third at the Dutch qualifying competition where only the first and second rider automatically qualified. The third spot had to be won during the Olympic 3000 metres race. To accomplish this three Dutch riders had to finish among the first 16 riders on the distance. Ireen Wüst and Renate Groenewold were expected to do this and indeed reached their goal with Wüst even winning the gold medal. Kleinsman was expected to reach the first 16 as well, but there were some doubts by analysts and the pressure on Kleinsman rose.</p><p>In the end Kleinsman under performed in her race, finishing in 17th position behind Anna Rokita who skated almost a second faster. As a result, Smit was unable to start at the 5000 metres and Kleinsman got under fire by the media again. Her reaction was that she felt sorry for Smit, but that it was not her problem. She did all she could, but was unable to skate faster. She said people should not blame her, if Smit wanted to race in Turin she had to skate faster at the qualifying tournament. Later during the Games she also skated in the pursuit team, where Smit also participated in. Kleinsman was unable to follow the team as soon as the half way mark was passed and the other members had to slow their speed. In the elimination rounds the Dutch faced high favourites Germany and were eliminated.</p><p>Unless her words the pressure remained and she had a hard time during her preparations for the next season. She was unable to get back to her good form she constantly had before the Turin incident and did not qualify for any of the major tournaments in the season like the World Cups, continental and world championships. However, besides her speed skating she still studies nursing in Enschede and therefore was eligible to qualify for the 2007 Winter Universiade, which were also held in Turin.</p><p>Kleinsman succeeded in the qualification program and was determined for another chance in Turin and to close the subject that resulted in her bad period. At the 1500 metres she did well among the top skaters and finished in a third position, which was good for a bronze medal. She also won a silver medal over 5000 metres and a gold in the team pursuit alongside Janneke Ensing and Diane Valkenburg.</p>	moniek kleinsman born 3 november 1982 is a dutch speed skater who was born in bentelo overijssel and currently resides in wolvega she competed at the 2006 winter olympicskleinsman got her first speed skating lessons at the age of four a few years later when she was getting more serious into the sport she was mainly focussing on short track speed skating just like her brother however at the age of twelve she decided to concentrate on long track speed skating instead after competing among the seniors for a few years her breakthrough came in the 2004–05 season when she won the dutch national allround championships that season she appeared on world cup meets became 7th at the european allround championships followed by an eighth position at the world allround championships finally at the knsb dutch single distance championships she won two bronze medals over 3000 and 5000 metres on 28 december 2005 kleinsman qualified herself for the 2006 winter olympics in turin at the 3000 metres it was the third time behind ireen wüst and renate groenewold a second try to qualify for the race over 5000 metres fails as she became fourth however she skated a personal best time that dayprior to the 2006 winter olympics kleinsman became under pressure by the dutch media as it was unsure whether 2002 winter olympics silver medalist gretha smit could participate at the olympic 5000 metres race smit finished third at the dutch qualifying competition where only the first and second rider automatically qualified the third spot had to be won during the olympic 3000 metres race to accomplish this three dutch riders had to finish among the first 16 riders on the distance ireen wüst and renate groenewold were expected to do this and indeed reached their goal with wüst even winning the gold medal kleinsman was expected to reach the first 16 as well but there were some doubts by analysts and the pressure on kleinsman rosein the end kleinsman under performed in her race finishing in 17th position behind anna rokita who skated almost a second faster as a result smit was unable to start at the 5000 metres and kleinsman got under fire by the media again her reaction was that she felt sorry for smit but that it was not her problem she did all she could but was unable to skate faster she said people should not blame her if smit wanted to race in turin she had to skate faster at the qualifying tournament later during the games she also skated in the pursuit team where smit also participated in kleinsman was unable to follow the team as soon as the half way mark was passed and the other members had to slow their speed in the elimination rounds the dutch faced high favourites germany and were eliminatedunless her words the pressure remained and she had a hard time during her preparations for the next season she was unable to get back to her good form she constantly had before the turin incident and did not qualify for any of the major tournaments in the season like the world cups continental and world championships however besides her speed skating she still studies nursing in enschede and therefore was eligible to qualify for the 2007 winter universiade which were also held in turinkleinsman succeeded in the qualification program and was determined for another chance in turin and to close the subject that resulted in her bad period at the 1500 metres she did well among the top skaters and finished in a third position which was good for a bronze medal she also won a silver medal over 5000 metres and a gold in the team pursuit alongside janneke ensing and diane valkenburg	Dutch speed skater and politician	dutch speed skater and politician	Sportspeople

Rail transport in Vietnam	"<p>The <b>railway system in Vietnam</b> is owned and operated by the state-owned Vietnam Railways (Vietnamese: <i lang=""vi"">Đường sắt Việt Nam</i>). The principal route, the single track North-South Railway running between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, accounts for 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi) of the network's total length of 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi). The national railway network uses mainly metre gauge, although there are several standard gauge and mixed gauge lines in the north of the country.</p><p>The first railways in Vietnam were established in the 1880s, with construction beginning in 1888; these included a tram running between the ports of Saigon and Cholon, and a regional rail line connecting Saigon with Mỹ Tho. Railway construction flourished soon afterwards, during the administration of Paul Doumer as Governor-General of French Indochina from 1897 to 1902. It was during this time that construction of the Yunnan–Vietnam and North–South railways began. Construction of the north–south line took over thirty years, finally ending in 1936, during which time other branch lines were also completed. Beginning in World War II, the entire rail network became a target of bombing attacks by a number of groups, including both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese troops during the Vietnam War. Although the main lines—particularly the North–South line—were quickly restored and returned to service once conflict ended, many branch lines were abandoned and dismantled at their expense, their infrastructure used to replace damaged sections of the main lines, or sold as scrap.</p><p>With increased economic growth brought on by the Doi Moi reforms of the late 1980s, the railway system has entered a renewed phase of development. A number of major projects supported by official development assistance have been proposed or are currently underway, including a series of projects to improve bridge and railway safety on the North-South Railway line, connections to Cambodia and Laos, and the restoration of a number of defunct lines, including the Đà Lạt–Tháp Chàm railway first established in the 1930s. A high-speed rail link between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City has also been proposed, which would reduce journey length from 30 hours to around 6 hours. Laos has held a ceremony but construction remains stalled (2019) on a rail line to Lao Bao from Savannakhet, across from the Thai rail head to Bangkok.

Kunming–Singapore railway	<p>The <b>Kunming–Singapore railway</b>, increasingly called the <b>Pan–Asia railway Network</b> is a network of railways that connects China, Singapore and all the countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The concept originated with British and French imperialists, who sought to link the railways they had built in southwest China, Indochina and Malaya, but international conflicts in the 20th century kept regional railways fragmented. The idea was formally revived in October 2006 when 18 Asian and Eurasian countries signed the Trans-Asian railway Network Agreement, which incorporated the Kunming–Singapore railway into the Trans-Asian railway network. </p><p>The network consists of three main routes from Kunming, China to Bangkok, Thailand: the Eastern route via Vietnam and Cambodia; the Central route via Laos, and the Western route via Myanmar.

Scenic viewpoint	<p>A <b>scenic viewpoint</b> – also called an <b>observation point</b>, <b>viewpoint</b>, <b>viewing point</b>, <b>vista point</b>, <b>lookout</b>, <b>scenic overlook</b>, etc. – is an elevated location where people can view scenery (often with binoculars) and photograph it. Scenic viewpoints may be created alongside mountain roads, often as simple turnouts or lay-bys where motorists can pull over onto pavement, gravel, or grass on the right-of-way. </p><p>Many viewpoints are larger, having parking areas, while some (typically on larger highways) are off the road completely. Viewing points may also be found on hill or mountain tops or on rocky spurs overlooking a valley and reached via a hiking trail. They may be protected by railings to protect the public or be enhanced by a viewing tower designed to elevate visitors above the surrounding terrain or trees in order to offer panoramic views. </p><p>Overlooks are frequently found in national parks, and in the U.S. along national parkways such as the Blue Ridge Parkway, which has numerous individually named overlooks for viewing the Blue Ridge Mountains and its valleys. Other overlooks are next to waterfalls, especially since mountain roads tend to follow streams. </p><p>Many overlooks are accessible only by trails and wooden walkways and stairs, especially in ecologically sensitive areas. These overlooks are often wooden decks, which minimize the impact on the land by reducing the need to disturb it for construction.</p> 	a scenic viewpoint – also called an observation point viewpoint viewing point vista point lookout scenic overlook etc – is an elevated location where people can view scenery often with binoculars and photograph it scenic viewpoints may be created alongside mountain roads often as simple turnouts or laybys where motorists can pull over onto pavement gravel or grass on the rightofway many viewpoints are larger having parking areas while some typically on larger highways are off the road completely viewing points may also be found on hill or mountain tops or on rocky spurs overlooking a valley and reached via a hiking trail they may be protected by railings to protect the public or be enhanced by a viewing tower designed to elevate visitors above the surrounding terrain or trees in order to offer panoramic views overlooks are frequently found in national parks and in the us along national parkways such as the blue ridge parkway which has numerous individually named overlooks for viewing the blue ridge mountains and its valleys other overlooks are next to waterfalls especially since mountain roads tend to follow streams many overlooks are accessible only by trails and wooden walkways and stairs especially in ecologically sensitive areas these overlooks are often wooden decks which minimize the impact on the land by reducing the need to disturb it for construction	high place where people can gather to view scenery	high place where people can gather to view scenery	Transport
Pyynikki Esker	"<p>The <b>Pyynikki Esker</b> (or the <b>Pyynikki Ridge</b>; Finnish: <i lang=""fi"">Pyynikinharju</i>) is the tallest longitudinal esker in the world, located in Pyynikki, Tampere, Finland. The ridge rises to a height of 160 meters above sea level and 80 meters above the surface of Lake Pyhäjärvi. The Pyynikki Esker belongs to the ridge formation that extends from South Ostrobothnia to Salpausselkä. The ridge formation continues west of the Pyynikki Esker as a rocky ridge known as the Pispala Esker (Pispalanharju) and Tahmela. To the east, after the settlement of Tampere, the ridge becomes the Kalevankangas esker, where there has been a cemetery by same name for almost 150 years. In Kangasala, the ridge formation continues as the four ridges called Kirkkoharju, Kuohunharju, Keisarinharju and Vehoniemenharju. The Pyynikki Esker, like longitudinal ridges, is mainly gravel and sand. </p><p>There are still some old European red pines growing in Pyynikki, whose roots are partly in the air, as the sandy ground rolls down towards Lake Pyhäjärvi over the years. Vegetation on gravel ridges has not only pines but also junipers that are protected. However, juniper berries can be picked when you remember that the branches should not be folded or the juniper should not be removed from the ground. There also grows Norway maples, which give the ridge a beautiful color in autumn. Mountain currants also grow on these ridges. In the middle of the heathers you can find golden chanterelles and in the autumn a few other edible mushrooms. Lingonberries also thrive on the southern slopes.</p><p>The Pyynikki observation tower, built in 1929, is still in use. It has a ground-level café. There are wooden stairs at several points on the slopes of Pyynikki, along which you can reach the top of the Pyynikki Esker from the shore of Lake Pyhäjärvi.</p> "	the pyynikki esker or the pyynikki ridge finnish pyynikinharju is the tallest longitudinal esker in the world located in pyynikki tampere finland the ridge rises to a height of 160 meters above sea level and 80 meters above the surface of lake pyhäjärvi the pyynikki esker belongs to the ridge formation that extends from south ostrobothnia to salpausselkä the ridge formation continues west of the pyynikki esker as a rocky ridge known as the pispala esker pispalanharju and tahmela to the east after the settlement of tampere the ridge becomes the kalevankangas esker where there has been a cemetery by same name for almost 150 years in kangasala the ridge formation continues as the four ridges called kirkkoharju kuohunharju keisarinharju and vehoniemenharju the pyynikki esker like longitudinal ridges is mainly gravel and sand there are still some old european red pines growing in pyynikki whose roots are partly in the air as the sandy ground rolls down towards lake pyhäjärvi over the years vegetation on gravel ridges has not only pines but also junipers that are protected however juniper berries can be picked when you remember that the branches should not be folded or the juniper should not be removed from the ground there also grows norway maples which give the ridge a beautiful color in autumn mountain currants also grow on these ridges in the middle of the heathers you can find golden chanterelles and in the autumn a few other edible mushrooms lingonberries also thrive on the southern slopesthe pyynikki observation tower built in 1929 is still in use it has a groundlevel café there are wooden stairs at several points on the slopes of pyynikki along which you can reach the top of the pyynikki esker from the shore of lake pyhäjärvi	esker in Tampere, Finland	esker in tampere finland	Transport

History of Duke University	<p>The <b>History of Duke University</b> began when Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school in Randolph County, North Carolina (in the present-day town of Trinity), was founded in 1838. The school was renamed to Union Institute Academy in 1841, Normal College in 1851, and to Trinity College in 1859. Finally moving to Durham in 1892, the school grew rapidly, primarily due to the generosity of Washington Duke and Julian S.

The Oxford University Act 1854 had abolished tests for the degree of BA, but not for higher degrees.

Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom	"<p> <b>Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom</b> can be divided into two broad categories: those in federal universities such as the University of London, which are primarily teaching institutions joined in a federation, and residential colleges in universities following (to a greater or lesser extent) the traditional collegiate pattern of Oxford and Cambridge, which may have academic responsibilities but are primarily residential and social. The legal status of colleges varies widely, both with regard to their corporate status and their status as educational bodies. London colleges are all considered 'recognised bodies' with the power to confer University of London degrees and, in many cases, their own degrees. Colleges of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) are 'listed bodies', as ""bodies that appear to the Secretary of State to be constituent colleges, schools, halls or other institutions of a university"". Colleges of the plate glass universities of Kent, Lancaster and York, along with those of the University of Roehampton and the University of the Arts London do not have this legal recognition. Colleges of Oxford (with three exceptions), Cambridge, London, and UHI, and the ""recognised colleges"" and ""licensed halls"" of Durham, are separate corporations, while the colleges of other universities, the ""maintained colleges"" of Durham, and the ""societies of the university"" at Oxford are parts of their parent universities and do not have independent corporate existence. </p><p>In the past, many of what are now British universities with their own degree-awarding powers were colleges which had their degrees awarded by either a federal university (such as Cardiff University) or validated by another university (for example many of the post-1992 universities). Colleges that had (or have) courses validated by a university are not normally considered to be colleges of that university; similarly the redbrick universities that, as university colleges, prepared students for University of London External Degrees were not considered colleges of that university.
