Palmolive Building	<p>The <b>Palmolive Building</b>, formerly the <b>Playboy Building</b>, is a 37-story Art Deco building at 919 N. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Built by Holabird &amp; Root, it was completed in 1929 and was home to the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Corporation. </p><p>The Palmolive Building was renamed the <b>Playboy Building</b> in 1965 when Playboy Enterprises purchased the leasehold of the building. It was home to the editorial and business offices of <i>Playboy</i> magazine from that time until 1989 when Playboy moved its offices to 680 N Lake Shore Drive. Playboy had sold the leasehold in 1980 and signed a 10-year lease that expired in 1990. The new leaseholder renamed the building 919 North Michigan Avenue.</p><p>During the time that Playboy was in the building, the word P-L-A-Y-B-O-Y was spelled out in 9-foot (2.7 m) illuminated letters on the north and south roofline. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2000, and it was added to the federal National Register of Historic Places in 2003. </p><p>In 2001, the building was sold to developer Draper and Kramer who, with Booth Hansen Architects, converted it to residential use with the first two floors dedicated to upscale office and retail space. High-end condos make up the rest of the building. The new owners restored the building's name to the Palmolive Building. The business address remains 919 North Michigan Avenue; however, the residential address is 159 East Walton Place. Notable residents of the building include Vince Vaughn, who bought a 12,000-square-foot triplex penthouse encompassing the 35th, 36th and 37th floors for $12 million. In February 2013, Vaughn offered the penthouse for sale as a pocket listing for $24.9 million. However, after multiple price cuts he chose in May 2016 to divide the unit in two, offering one for $8.5 million, and the other smaller unit for $4.2 million.</p>	dedicated building 1965 2013 architect 35th east north historic word colgatepalmolivepeet first divide unit after corporation n he home 2016 2003 renamed vaughn michigan by in to may upscale space however pocket 159 offering playboy retail 12 cut rest editorial a time landmark vince on price one wa lake bought palmolive 1929 encompassing up listing two 10year completed converted remains sale include 2000 new use leasehold is when chose office kramer restored avenue root that lease avenueduring residential million penthouse address m 2001 37th name 9foot with 1980 south it register resident 249 holabird until 42 condo expired of spelled notable triplex 37story who owner other floor shore business had 12000squarefoot offered make for 1990 and added walton hansen multiple from illuminated moved place leaseholder built art national draper amp booth out drive formerly february smaller 36th purchased signed letter 85 designated 680 magazine sold developer deco 919 the 27 roofline highend 1989 federal at enterprise chicago	building in Chicago	in building chicago	Written_communication
1271 Avenue of the Americas	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>1271 Avenue of the Americas </b> is a 48-story skyscraper on Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas), between 50th and 51st Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Designed by architect Wallace Harrison of Harrison, Abramovitz, and Harris, the building was developed between 1956 and 1960 as part of Rockefeller Center. It was originally known as the <b>Time &amp; Life Building</b> for its main tenant, Time Inc., which also published <i>Life</i> magazine. </p><p>1271 Avenue of the Americas contains an eight-story base that partially wraps around the main shaft, as well as a plaza with white-and-gray serpentine pavement and water fountains. The facade consists of glass panels between limestone columns. The lobby contains serpentine floors; white-marble and stainless-steel walls; reddish-burgundy glass ceilings; and artwork by Josef Albers, Fritz Glarner, and Francis Brennan. The ground floor also includes storefronts and originally also housed La Fonda del Sol, a Latin American-themed restaurant. Each of the upper floors measures 28,000 sq ft (2,600 m<sup>2</sup>) and consists of a column-free space around a mechanical core. The 48th floor originally contained the Hemisphere Club, a members-only restaurant during the day. </p><p>After Time Inc. expressed its intention to move from 1 Rockefeller Plaza in the 1950s, Rockefeller Center's owners proposed the skyscraper to meet the company's needs while retaining it as a tenant. Construction started in May 1957, the building was topped out during November 1958, and occupants began moving into their offices in late 1959. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Time-Life Building's lobby as a city landmark in 2002. Time Inc. vacated the building in 2015, and the building was subsequently renovated between 2015 and 2019. </p>"	serpentine 1956 york building moving 2019 tenant architect around an lobby limestone m2 commission club after by 1 vacated in while to 28000 may need rockefeller space restaurant known ft expressed 2600 construction shaft renovated whiteandgray a time 1960 meet on which landmark wa 1950s ground harris plaza consists column street mechanical intention originally topped late new josef glass includes midtown 48th is abramovitz panel each occupant office avenue storefront that designed published fountain timelife wall housed americanthemed eightstory la harrison base albers ceiling with wallace life main reddishburgundy glarner part fritz it during 1957 neighborhood started of owner francis brennan pavement developed core floor membersonly their into sixth retaining manhattan upper contained 50th for sq skyscraper wrap and del from stainlesssteel columnfree between latin november 2002 day partially whitemarble inc 1959 preservation fonda amp company out hemisphere america measure also artwork city designated 1271 magazine water 2015 move the sol proposed 48story 1958 well 51st began center subsequently facade contains	skyscraper located in Rockefeller Center in New York City	city york skyscraper in center new located rockefeller	Written_communication
The Knickerbocker Hotel	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>The Knickerbocker Hotel</b> is a hotel at Times Square, on the southeastern corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Built by John Jacob Astor IV, the hostelry was designed in 1901 and opened in 1906. Its location near the Theater District around Times Square was intended to attract not only residential guests but also theater visitors. </p><p>The Knickerbocker Hotel is largely designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Marvin &amp; Davis, with Bruce Price as consultant. Its primary frontages are on Broadway and 42nd Street. These facades are constructed of red brick with terracotta details and a prominent mansard roof. The Knickerbocker Hotel also incorporates an annex on 41st Street, built in 1894 as part of the St. Cloud Hotel, which formerly occupied the site. The 41st Street facade contains a Romanesque Revival design by Philip C. Brown. Inside, the hotel contains 300 rooms, a restaurant, a coffee shop, and a roof bar. The original interior design was devised in 1905 by Trowbridge &amp; Livingston. There are scattered remnants of the original interior design, including an entrance that formerly led from the New York City Subway's Times Square station to the hotel's basement. </p><p>The original hotel, which served as the home of Enrico Caruso and George M. Cohan, shuttered in 1920 following a decrease in business. The building was then converted to offices, becoming known as the Knickerbocker Building. It was the home of <i>Newsweek</i> magazine from 1940 to 1959 during which it was called the Newsweek Building. After major renovations in 1980, it became known as 1466 Broadway and was used as garment showrooms and offices. Following another renovation in 2001, it was known as 6 Times Square. The Knickerbocker was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1988. It was converted back to a hotel from 2013 to 2015 under its original name. </p>"	york room building used occupied 2013 around caruso davis served brown shuttered an historic district decrease livingston jacob after only subway home bruce by st in john near coffee to led beauxarts frontage inside restaurant opened known trowbridge mansard c garment these showroom 1466 a time terracotta major on price which landmark wa constructed street 41st converted consultant brick new corner knickerbocker basement southeastern 1920 1905 hotel midtown is office red that designed residential becoming m 2001 prominent guest name broadway with astor there shop site 1980 1906 part it not became register theater revival 42nd during following neighborhood newsweek incorporates square of intended 300 primary 1894 annex remnant including business manhattan location style iv roof enrico and added under 6 from philip george place design built station 1959 national hostelry visitor another amp back formerly largely cohan renovation also 1988 then city are designated magazine cloud original 2015 marvin devised the detail 1901 scattered called interior attract bar romanesque at but facade contains 1940 entrance	hotel in Manhattan, New York	york hotel in manhattan new	Written_communication

The Book (short story)	"<p>""<b>The Book</b>"" is an unfinished short story by American horror fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft, believed to have been written in late 1933. It was first published in the journal <i>Leaves</i> in 1938, after Lovecraft's death.</p><p>In the story fragment, the narrator is given an ancient book by a strange bookseller, and when he takes it home and examines it, weird and sinister events ensue. </p><p>In October 1933, Lovecraft wrote in a letter: </p> <blockquote class=""templatequote""><p>I am at a sort of standstill in writing—disgusted at much of my older work, and uncertain as to avenues of improvement. In recent weeks I have done a tremendous amount of experimenting with different styles and perspectives, but have destroyed most of the results.</p></blockquote> <p>The <i>H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia</i> suggests that ""The Book"" was one of the undestroyed experiments—an attempt to translate Lovecraft's poem sequence <i>Fungi from Yuggoth</i> into prose. (The completed fragment corresponds to the first three sonnets, which form more of a coherent narrative than the rest of the sequence.)</p><p>""The Black Tome of Alsophocus"", first published in <i>New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos</i> (1969), is an attempt by Martin S. Warnes to complete ""The Book"". Warnes turns the fragment into a tale of possession by Nyarlathotep.</p><p>In 2019, the latter Warnes completion was adapted into a short film of the same name.

My Immortal (fan fiction)	"<p><i><b>My Immortal</b></i> is a <i>Harry Potter</i>-based fan fiction serially published on FanFiction.net between 2006 and 2007. Though notable for its convoluted narrative and constant digressions, the story largely centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named ""Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way"" and her relationships with the characters of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, particularly her romantic relationship with Draco Malfoy, culminating in her traveling back in time to defeat the main antagonist of the series, Lord Voldemort (or 'Vlodemort'). </p><p><i>My Immortal</i> is popularly regarded as one of the worst works of fan fiction ever written. Since the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its constant grammar and spelling errors, plot inconsistencies and complete disregard for the original <i>Harry Potter</i> source material. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a YouTube web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life. </p><p>The author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as ""unsolvable"". The author published the story under the username ""XXXbloodyrists666XXX"" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a FictionPress account stating that she had created an active Tumblr account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of young adult novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of <i>My Immortal</i> and had provided evidence of her authorship to Macmillan Publishers, but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship. </p><p>The story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to fool and troll readers or to satirize fan fiction, but others consider the work and the alleged online presence of the author too elaborate to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that <i>My Immortal</i> is a work of satire, though her authorship is disputed. </p> "	worst never doubt vlodemort this or someone over an plot 2017 hoax ever online deemed authorship culminating digression web particularly stating by immortal antagonist active potter in her to be ebony led disputed material 2007 satirize memoir a time one on young wa gilesbie two fool narrative source infamy serially rose draco series claiming publisher thenforthcoming character raven xxxbloodyrists666xxx same effectively is voldemort stated harry that published designed identity troll defeat derivative been many satire name alleged written youtube with macmillan fictionpress main life reader since error month potterbased it work novelist tumblr dementia september female fake malfoy notable of spelling controversy convoluted fiction lord complete unsolvable way christo traveling adolescent noncanonical including had vampire author account consider popularly despite for 2006 regarded and under multiple others evidence she fan between inspired real grammar updated publication ha back adult darkness elaborate largely relationship gained provided my also factual fanfictionnet named romantic inconsistency original locate confirmed presence selfidentified viewed effort the story constant nostalgia too though resulted disregard tara speculated center but created coauthor username	work of fan fiction that inspired various derivative works	various derivative of that work fiction fan inspired	Written_communication
On Social Freedom	"<p><b>On Social Freedom: or the Necessary Limits of Individual Freedom Arising Out of the Conditions of Our Social Life</b> is an essay regarding individual and societal freedom initially thought to have been written by the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, but later found to have been falsely attributed to him.</p><p>Discovered in 1907 among the possessions left in the home at which Mill died in Avignon, France, it was published in June 1907 as a special article in The Oxford and Cambridge Review. The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing <i>On Liberty</i>, but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work <i>Mill and His Early Critics</i>. </p><p>Rees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:</p> <blockquote><p>In September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled ""Social Freedom."" Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of ""promise rather than performance"" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not ""to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence."" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he ""should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.""</p></blockquote> <p>The letter is included in Mill's <i>Collected Works</i> where Edger is identified as ""probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of G.J. Holyoake in the promoting of the co-operative movement, writer for <i>The Secular World</i> and author of tracts on co-operation."" Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in <i>The History of Co-operation</i>:</p> <blockquote><p>""Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be ""manly, open, and ingenious appearance,"" beyond what he expected of one belonging to the ""depressed"" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:- </p><blockquote><p>""I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell'). I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm. There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only <i>bounty</i> of the squire towards poor neighbours. </p><p>(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish. (2) Each member can hold only one share. (3) Members have no voice in the management. (4) Wages to workmen same as usual. (5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders. The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant. It has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way. Remember, I only give my impressions."" </p> </blockquote></blockquote> <p>An E.R. Edger is also listed in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 24 April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.</p>"	found 1956 beyond term doubt case crysell reply existence his this or assington enthusiasm individual promoting did rees died appraisal against whom thinking an 4 significant listed surgeon very attributed appearance only promise he authorship certain home neglect class mode left society particularly 1869 about attributing by 1 physiology columbia john in inquiry politely impression to form crisell mr be all they journal however edger jc associate conversation holyoake college have squire mention shareholder university examination having inducement hold limit writer a time receipt on which cambridge liberal wa view manuscript summarised entitled elicit say colleague sense up care decided collected fortyone article inhabitant where renovate included comment sign rev definition depressed societal himdiscovered volume republished scanlan history paid later visit same employ possession is 1907 scholar subsistence exhorts each e wage set that 1941 france published mill visited royal avignon report me attention limited regarding been among many manager poor management sent ingenious freedom what written remember with england there arising give review life oxford 1955 how probably remarked performance were writing can towards our june it work not stuart right ebenezer voice pronounced condition full your september manly usual of thought much special intended failed will other open long critic feel way philosopher ended primary should explanation cooperation had tract doing surrounding author offered raised seems secular for jp hoped robinson anatomy continue concerining early and ten necessary movement if from apparently capacity medical bounty passed several identified so art sample expected er ha member falsely out philosophical world 5 take wrote 2 parish 1862 also especially my neighbour 3 republish 24 containing letter then no briefly cooperative april essay british gj position initially rather one mostly than acknowledging r the workman farm become year detail reess find though i attract belonging press at but social competence share gaining liberty	book by John Stuart Mill	by john book stuart mill	Written_communication

Eltono	"<p><b>Eltono</b> is a French artist born in the suburbs of Paris in 1975. His work is mostly influenced by his graffiti background. He started painting around 1989 in his neighborhood mostly on train tracks and highway walls. ""Eltono focused mainly on the railway lines to the northwest of the city, painting in the traditional silver and black, block letter Parisian style."" He lived in Madrid from 1999 to 2010 (where he got his pseudonym), then in Beijing from 2010 to 2014 and since 2014 lives in the south of France. In 1999, while living in Madrid, he started painting abstract symbols with tape and acrylic paint. ""It was then that he developed the colorful geometric box patterns for which he is now known."" ""As Eltono himself suggested, his move away from traditional graffiti was produced so as to find a harmony with both the material and the social body of the city (integrating both its architectonic and societal elements in a more consensual manner)."" ""Eltono also rejects conventional letterforms in favor of a minimalism device with which to negotiate space.""</p><p>Eltono's work is mainly influenced by the urban environment and questions the limits between public and private space.

Malina Suliman	"<p><b>Malina Suliman,</b> a graffiti artist, metalworker, and painter, was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1990. As a child, she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in Kandahar, Afghan. Her work is considered to challenge traditional Muslim culture like the burqa. According to Suliman, ""The burqa is a way of controlling, but in the name of respect. Every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa. It is honor, culture, and religion. Really, it just controls the woman and keeps her inside."" Malina's work has gained the attention of the Taliban and traditional Muslims, resulting in having received threats from the Taliban towards Suliman and her family. The artist was subject to physical threats, rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her work.</p><p>Not only does Malina worry about the Taliban, but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art. Writing art that that displays the human body like Malina's motif, the skeleton in a burqa, is seen as idol worship. To the Taliban and other traditional Muslims, Malina's artwork is un-Islamic and Suliman's parents were embarrassed. Because of this her parents went the distance and locked Malina in their house for nearly a year, which had the opposite effect they were hoping for. Malina claimed that, “Today, whatever I am doing for art, it’s all because of that one year in which I was staying in a home.” Suliman spends her time holding art exhibits around the world. In December 2019, Malina intended to hold a lecture on the colonization of art in Rome but it was cancelled. </p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1423 Cached time: 20220514215637 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.225 seconds Real time usage: 0.287 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1675/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 10806/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1002/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 16/100 Expensive parser function count: 0/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 8283/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.124/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3517711/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 268.254 1 -total 65.21% 174.915 1 Template:Infobox_artist 61.96% 166.205 1 Template:Infobox_person 48.80% 130.912 1 Template:Infobox 29.29% 78.576 2 Template:Cite_web 20.80% 55.799 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 15.01% 40.272 1 Template:Birth_year_and_age 7.44% 19.969 16 Template:Main_other 5.29% 14.183 9 Template:Pluralize_from_text 3.06% 8.220 2 Template:Cite_news -->"	house “ painter this or 2019 rock around resulting like display only thrown religion home hoping just worknot about honor in her to disagrees all ” they create respect inside have considered worship having hold a time one which artist on wa burqa kandahar taliban because opposite family distance skeleton afghan today parent metalworker idol human is that malinas according ’ attention doe been malina name staying december province lecture with give child keep forced seen exhibit towards were writing physical am whatever kabul flee it work received threat of muslim who embarrassed intended suliman way other their subject control unislamic graffiti s had doing for body 1990 and challenge from sulimans she nearly art ha world born went spends really traditional motif gained claimed holding artwork afghanistan woman every controlling effect culture conduct colonization locked rome the worry year different cancelled i decision live at but	Afghan artist	afghan artist	Written_communication

Genius (literature)	"<p>The concept of <b>genius,</b> in literary theory and literary history, derives from the later 18th century, when it began to be distinguished from <i>ingenium</i> in a discussion of the <i>genius loci,</i> or ""spirit of the place."" It was a way of discussing essence, in that each place was supposed to have its own unique and immutable nature, but this essence was determinant, in that all persons of a place would be infused or inspired by that nature. In the early nationalistic literary theories of the Augustan era, each nation was supposed to have a nature determined by its climate, air, and fauna that made a nation's poetry, manners, and art singular. It created national character. </p><p>T.V.F. Brogan argues that ""genius"" is a middle term in the evolution of the idea of inspiration and poetic ability from a belief in an external source (<i>afflatus,</i> or divine infection, and poetic phrenzy, or divine madness) and an internal source (imagination and the subconscious). However, the concept became nearly identical with poetic madness and divine madness in later Romanticism. The word itself was conflated with the Latin <i>ingenium</i> (natural ability) by the time of the Renaissance, and it thereby becomes a natural spirit or natural essence unique to the individual and yet derived from the place. In this sense, it is still a term synonymous with skill. </p>"	supposed term natural evolution this or essence individual locus word an divine still belief by in to be all however climate have imagination madness discussing a romanticism time conflated wa sense air source itself century ability 18th augustan nation immutable character history later is when each that idea singular theory derived ingenium with determinant external it became infused determined of internal own nature spirit way brogan poetry renaissance becomes derives nationalistic identical concept early inspiration and from inspired would place infection latin thereby argues nearly art national manner made tvf subconscious person yet era afflatus distinguished phrenzy skill discussion unique the fauna synonymous middle poetic genius began literary but created	concept in literary theory and literary history	theory and in literary concept history	Written_communication
Heroic Age (literary theory)	"<p>In 20th century studies of oral poetry and traditional literature, the <b>Heroic Age</b> was postulated as a stage in the development of human societies likely to give rise to legends about heroic deeds. According to some theorists, oral epic poetry would be created at the same period, and would be transmitted, by singers who displayed less creativity, through later periods. Scholars who adopted the theory of a Heroic Age include: </p> <ul><li>Maurice Bowra</li> <li>Hector Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick</li></ul><p>A widely shared view was that each society would pass through a Heroic Age only once. This apparently explains why, in the Chadwicks' world survey of oral and traditional poetry, <i>The Growth of Literature</i>, medieval European epics such as the French <i>Chansons de geste</i> and the Spanish <i>Cantar de Mio Cid</i> are omitted: those societies are taken to have passed through a Heroic Age earlier. </p><p>Bryan Hainsworth has suggested that in the various so-called Heroic Ages named by modern scholars ""what is described is a by-product ... of the tendency of heroic poetry to congeal into cycles, often ... around a signal event"" (1993, p. 40). </p>"	nora described this often stage p around 20th geste congeal postulated suggested cid le only heroic growth explains at development society rise about tendency by in chadwicks to be earlier theorist singer have survey various a view wa 40 displayed shared byproduct century oral include chansons human same later taken is hainsworth scholar each spanish bowra that such according theory mio what bryan give widely maurice adopted signal study medieval epic hector omitted some likely legend of poetry into pas cantar and those apparently through passed would modern munro socalled once deed chadwick ha european world chadwicka period traditional transmitted cycle age are french named creativity event 1993 the kershaw why literature de who created	term in literary theory	theory in literary term	Written_communication
Focalisation	<p><b>Focalisation</b> is a term coined by the French narrative theorist Gérard Genette. It refers to the perspective through which a narrative is presented. Genette focuses on the interplay between three forms of <i>focalization</i> and the distinction between <i>heterodiegetic</i> and <i>homodiegetic</i> narrators. Homodiegetic narrators exist in the same (hence the prefix 'homo') storyworld as the characters exist in, whereas heterodiegetic narrators are not a part of that storyworld. The term 'focalization' refers to how information is restricted in storytelling. Genette distinguishes between <i>internal</i> focalization, <i>external</i> focalization, and <i>zero</i> focalization. Internal focalization means that the narrative focuses on thoughts and emotions while external focalization focuses solely on characters' actions, behavior, the setting etc. Zero focalization is seen when the narrator is omniscient in the sense that it is not restricted. </p> 	how a coined seen term which on part mean focalisation distinction sense hence external narrator it not behavior solely setting narrative focalization restricted of emotion internal omniscient etc storytelling thought character distinguishes action homo refers same storyworld interplay are french gérard is by when in three that to presented form zero while theorist the homodiegetic prefix focus and genette information perspective exist through whereas between heterodiegetic	perspective through which a narrative is presented	narrative a which is perspective presented through	Written_communication

Panaitescu</b>, also known as <b>Panait Șt. Dumitru</b>, <b>D. P. Perpessicius</b> and <b>Panaitescu-Perpessicius</b>; October 22, 1891 – March 29, 1971) was a Romanian literary historian and critic, poet, essayist and fiction writer. One of the prominent literary chroniclers of the Romanian interwar, he stood apart in his generation for having thrown his support behind the modernist and avant-garde currents of Romanian literature. As a theorist, Perpessicius merged the tenets of Symbolism with the pragmatic conservative principles of the 19th century <i>Junimea</i> society, but was much-criticized over perceptions that, in the name of aesthetic relativism, he tolerated literary failure. Also known as an anthologist, biographer, museologist, folklorist and book publisher, he was, together with George Călinescu, one of his generation's best-known researchers to have focused on the work of <i>Junimist</i> author and since-acknowledged national poet Mihai Eminescu. Much of Perpessicius' career was dedicated to collecting, structuring and interpreting Eminescu's texts, resulting in an authoritative edition of Eminescu's writings, the 17-volume <i>Opere</i> (""Works""). </p><p>A veteran of World War I, where he lost use of his right arm, Perpessicius debuted in poetry while recovering in hospital, publishing the critically acclaimed volume <i>Scut și targă</i> (""Shield and Stretcher""). His subsequent ""intimist"" and Neoclassical tendencies made him part of a distinct current within the local branch of Symbolism. Like other mainstream modernists of his day, Perpessicius also espoused anti-fascism and criticized nationalism in general, attitudes which led him into conflict with the 1930s far right. In 1938-1940 however, Perpessicius controversially offered a degree of support to the fascist-inspired National Renaissance Front, and was promoted by its leader, King Carol II. Sympathetic to the left-wing trend after World War II, Perpessicius was drawn into cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party. Although subsequently endorsed and acclaimed by the communist regime, Perpessicius was reluctant to condone its policies and dedicated his final years almost exclusively to literature. A member of the Romanian Academy and founding director of the Museum of Romanian Literature, he was co-editor of <i>Viața Românească</i> magazine, and, in 1957, head of the Academy's Library. </p>"	panait pen 29 dedicated war policy october his over espoused acclaimed him eminescu p resulting like an publishing stretcher 17volume și fascistinspired authoritative after dumitru he thrown junimea director society d tendency 1930s by in while to general led theorist however 1971 relativism biographer communist known arm have lost museum march scut far having historian structuring researcher writer controversially almost a one on romanian which wa panaitescu failure nationalism generation library 22 debuted century where carol king neoclassical criticized șt tolerated publisher distinct use academy volume românească final essayist mainstream promoted hospital branch that veteran recovering critically chronicler museologist career reluctant shield sinceacknowledged conservative prominent stood name folklorist founding with antifascism drawn 19381940 exclusively degree part writing subsequent it work perpessicius right head 1957 mihai leftwing of sympathetic local călinescu fiction much – other regime leader critic poetry collecting text avantgarde merged into renaissance s cooperation apart book author behind modernist tenet targă offered principle for viața and bestknown ii panaitescuperpessicius perception aesthetic george interpreting front day within national interwar junimist symbolism member 1891 intimist world trend opere muchcriticized made coeditor together current also party although perpeˈsit͡ʃjus support pragmatic magazine attitude conflict endorsed 19th anthologist the eminescus year focused condone literature i literary but subsequently poet edition	Romanian writer	romanian writer	Written_communication

A representative of Ancient Greek literature of the Hellenistic period, he wrote over 800 literary works in a wide variety of genres, most of which did not survive. He espoused an aesthetic philosophy, known as Callimacheanism, which exerted a strong influence on the poets of the Roman Empire and, through them, on all subsequent Western literature. </p><p>Born into a prominent family in the Greek city of Cyrene in modern-day Libya, he was educated in Alexandria, the capital of the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt. After working as a schoolteacher in the city, he came under the patronage of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus and was employed at the Library of Alexandria where he compiled the <i>Pinakes</i>, a comprehensive catalogue of all Greek literature. He is believed to have lived into the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes. </p><p>Although Callimachus wrote prolifically in prose and poetry, only a small number of his poetical texts have been preserved. His main works are the <i>Aetia</i>, a four-book aetiological poem, six religious hymns, around 60 epigrams, a collection of satirical iambs, and a narrative poem entitled <i>Hecale</i>. Callimachus shared many characteristics with his Alexandrian contemporaries Aratus, Apollonius of Rhodes and Theocritus, but professed to adhere to a unique style of poetry: favouring small, recondite and even obscure topics, he dedicated himself to small-scale poetry and refused to write longwinded epic poetry, the most prominent literary art of his day. </p><p>Callimachus and his aesthetic philosophy became an important point of reference for Roman poets of the late Republic and the early Empire. Catullus, Horace, Vergil, Propertius, and Ovid saw his poetry as one of their ""principal model[s]"" and engaged with it in a variety of ways. Modern classical scholars view him as one of the most influential Greek poets. According to the Hellenist Kathryn Gutzwiller, he ""reinvented Greek poetry for the Hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came, through its manifestations in Roman poetry, to influence the entire tradition of modern literature"".</p>"	satirical variety dedicated alexandrian gutzwiller his over espoused even philosophy did employed him around hellenist an 3rd 60 after only he at came reference lived by active republic in to all modernday model cyrene personal obscure known vergil have preserved influential aetia c aratus representative hymn hellenistic ptolemy religious a one which on alexandria most wa view them entitled shared callimacheanism himself recondite library genre family collection narrative century where six kathryn king capital late romanized educated roman is scholar that according euergetes prominent been wide many saw classical working theocritus rhodes 240 adhere with main but librarian engaged comprehensive subsequent hecale number it work not became manifestation during epic pinakes apollonius schoolteacher principal of reign – compiled kallimachos point 310 way catalogue poetry 800 text their influence into strong horace libya longwinded write for style early and under believed empire ptolemaic καλλίμαχος ii ovid through characteristic aesthetic modern philadelphus day prolifically exerted art tradition reinvented prose devising important iii propertius born period wrote epigram survive favouring smallscale entire ancient bc although small city poem are refused age catullus callimachus contemporary greek western poetical unique the topic professed iamb aetiological literature literary egypt who fourbook poet patronage	ancient poet and librarian	and ancient librarian poet	Written_communication

After teaching humanities and theology at several schools, like Coimbra where most of the Jesuit letters were available in uncensored form, he was chosen rector of Braga, then missionary to the Azores; he was distinguished by his zeal. He wrote <i>A História das Missões dos Jesuítas no Oriente, Até ao Ano de 1568</i> (History of the Jesuit Missionaries to the East, until 1568). The manuscript was sent to Rome, translated into Latin, and was then given to the young novice Giovanni Pietro Maffei (1533-1603) to prepare it for publication. Maffei added a considerable amount of text to Acosta's work, entitled De Japonicis rebus epistolarum. This part contains abridged Latin translations of letters sent from the Jesuits working in Japan until the year 1564.

Epitome	"<p>An <b>epitome</b> (<span></span>; Greek: <span lang=""el"">ἐπιτομή</span>, from ἐπιτέμνειν <i>epitemnein</i> meaning ""to cut short"") is a summary or miniature form, or an instance that represents a larger reality, also used as a synonym for embodiment. Epitomacy represents ""to the degree of."" An abridgment differs from an epitome in that an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed, as opposed to the epitome, which is an original summation of a work, at least in part. </p><p>Many documents from the Ancient Greek and Roman worlds survive now only ""in epitome,"" referring to the practice of some later authors (epitomators) who wrote distilled versions of larger works now lost. Some writers attempted to convey the stance and spirit of the original, while others added further details or anecdotes regarding the general subject. As with all secondary historical sources, a different bias not present in the original may creep in. </p><p>Documents surviving in epitome differ from those surviving only as fragments quoted in later works and those used as unacknowledged sources by later scholars, as they can stand as discrete documents but refracted through the views of another author. </p><p>Epitomes of a kind are still produced today when dealing with a corpus of literature, especially classical works often considered dense, unwieldy and unlikely to be read by the average person, to make them more accessible: some are more along the lines of abridgments, such as many which have been written of Edward Gibbon's <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, a work of eight large volumes (about 3600 pages) often published as one volume of about 1400 pages. Mini-epitomes is like an extension of matched templates but with smarter patches can be learnt by the EM algorithm: extending k‐means. A single mini-epitome can then be used to match many image patches with different variables. To deal with shift-invariance, mini-epitomes employ additional hidden variables. It was able to locate the patch in the epitome and lower the reconstruction error. </p><p>Some are of the same type as the ancient epitome, such as various epitomes of the <i>Summa Theologiae</i> of Thomas Aquinas, originally written as an introductory textbook in theology and now accessible to very few except for the learned in theology and Aristotelian philosophy, such as <i>A Summa of the Summa</i> and <i>A Shorter Summa</i>. Many epitomes today are published under the general title ""The Companion to ..."", such as <i>The Oxford Companion to Aristotle</i>, or ""An Overview of ..."", or ""guides,"" such as <i>An Overview of the Thought of Immanuel Kant</i>, <i>How to Read Hans Urs von Balthasar</i>, or, in some cases, as an introduction, in the cases of <i>An Introduction to Søren Kierkegaard</i> or <i>A Very Short Introduction to the New Testament</i> (many philosophical ""introductions"" and ""guides"" share the epitomic form, unlike general ""introductions"" to a field). </p> "	extending average larger case kierkegaard fragment practice or often used line smarter philosophy distilled composed like an miniature except embodiment short very shorter epitome em only still refracted at image about testament by meaning in while to form general all may they be field summary ἐπιτομή accessible able overview lost considered unlikely have large variable ur differ read cut reality writer various a 3600 introduction one which view wa them convey further few source instance creep template originally extension least today new history volume miniepitomes anecdote employ roman later dense same unacknowledged is title scholar bias when that published such eight document synonym version deal unwieldy additional regarding been many classical written represents with page epitemnein edward algorithm oxford selected how degree part writing can error patch summa thomas differs work not it learned aquinas hidden some of shiftinvariance epitomacy 1400 thought spirit type corpus quoted introductory textbook learnt subject author matched kant kind abridgment for summation make decline balthasar aristotelian and added those under others from produced empire k‐means through theology guide now reconstruction aristotle søren match referring another epitomic fall single philosophical world dealing made lower wrote theologiae survive person han also especially miniepitome ancient attempted then are no companion original present more greek locate opposed gibbon stance surviving unlike the von different detail secondary stand along historical literature epitomators discrete ἐπιτέμνειν immanuel who but quotation share	summary, short version of a literary work	version a of short literary work summary	Written_communication

Vancouver system	"<p>The <b>Vancouver system</b>, also known as <b>Vancouver reference style</b> or the <b>author–number system</b>, is a citation style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the physical sciences and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the author–date, or ""Harvard"", system. Vancouver style is used by MEDLINE and PubMed.</p><p>Hundreds of scientific journals use author–number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as punctuation, casing of titles, and italic, vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names ""Vancouver system"" or ""Vancouver style"" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is <i>Citing Medicine</i>, per the <i>References &gt; Style and Format</i> section of the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals. These recommendations, the <i>Vancouver Convention</i> and <i>Vancouver guidelines</i>, have a much broader scope than only the citation style: they provide ethical guidelines for writers and rules for co-authorship in scientific collaborations to avoid fraud. The Convention further entails compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and research projects must be recommended by an independent ethics committee.</p><p>In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author–number system regardless of the formatting details. A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author–number format specified by the ICMJE Recommendations (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM). For example, the AMA reference style is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author–number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed). </p>"	referencing or over used citing minor bracketed pubmedhundreds icmje system existed an guideline only collaboration format mask refers reference by entry in section to all pointing output ethical journal they scholarly be specified known per example vary have follow nlmpubmed these logic writer any a harvard one manuscript sense them narrow medline because two further century essential definition use casing same being scientific is punctuation title fraud editing refer italic that gt convention citation avoid such helsinki us version trivial declaration science entail among recommended what name specific author–number with regardless narrower widely project italicized physical since must number it work 1978 uniform not differs some list conforms of reporting independent much other rule text broad for style popular and scope ama ethic from formatting urm medical whether recommendation numbered within publication medicine vancouver committeein research latest also broader requirement compliance although provide are conduct latter author–date than coauthorship the detail normally but	style of referencing	style referencing of	Written_communication
Bad quarto	"<p>A <b>bad quarto</b>, in Shakespearean scholarship, is a quarto-sized printed edition of one of Shakespeare's plays that is considered to be unauthorised, and is theorised to have been pirated from a theatrical performance without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or, alternatively, written down later from memory by an actor or group of actors in the cast – the latter process has been termed ""memorial reconstruction"". Since the quarto derives from a performance, hence lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to be ""bad"", i.e. to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.</p><p>In contrast, a ""good quarto"" is considered to be a text that is authorised and which may have been printed from the author's manuscript (or a working draft thereof, known as his <i>foul papers</i>), or from a scribal copy or prompt copy derived from the manuscript or <i>foul papers</i>.</p><p>The concept of the <i>bad quarto</i> originates in 1909, attributed to A W Pollard and W W Gregg. The theory defines as ""bad quartos"" the first quarto printings of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Henry V</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>, and seeks to explain why there are substantial textual differences between those quartos and the 1623 printing of the first folio edition of the plays. </p><p>The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's <i>The Battle of Alcazar</i>, Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and the collaborative script, <i>Sir Thomas More</i>.</p><p>The theory has been accepted, studied and expanded by many scholars; but some modern scholars are challenging it and those, such as Eric Sams, consider the entire theory to be without foundation.

False Folio	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>False Folio</b> is the term that Shakespeare scholars and bibliographers have applied to William Jaggard's printing of ten Shakespearean and pseudo-Shakespearean plays together in 1619, the first attempt to collect Shakespeare's work in a single volume. There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC. The other is held in the Special Collections at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p>The term ""false folio"" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the First Folio of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description ""folio"" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual quarto format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is <i>false</i> folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by Alfred W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his <i>Shakespeare Folios and Quartos</i>.</p><p>In summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice. Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: Stationers Company; Stationers' Register], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were: </p> <ul><li><i>Henry V</i> – ""printed for T. P. 1608"" on the title page. False date. Thomas Pavier was the stationer who possessed the rights to <i>Henry V</i>, and was an associate of Jaggard.</li> <li><i>King Lear</i> – ""Printed for Nathaniel Butter 1608."" False date and name. Nicholas Okes had printed Q1 of <i>Lear</i> for Butter in 1608.</li> <li><i>The Merchant of Venice</i> – ""Printed by J. Roberts, 1600."" False date and name. This was one play to which Jaggard did not have valid title; it belonged to stationer Laurence Hayes.</li> <li><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> – ""Printed for Arthur Johnson, 1619."" False date and name. Johnson published Q1 of <i>Merry Wives</i> in 1602.</li> <li><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> – ""Printed by James Roberts, 1600."" False date and name.</li> <li><i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i> – ""Printed for T. P. 1619"", date ""corrected"" to 1609 in second state.</li> <li><i>Sir John Oldcastle</i> – ""printed for T. P. 1600"". False date.</li> <li><i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i> – ""Printed for T. P. 1619.""</li> <li><i>The Whole Contention Between the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York</i> – ""Printed at London, for T. P."" This was the major innovation of the collection: Jaggard joined together two previously separate texts, <i>The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster</i> (the early version of <i>Henry VI, Part 2,</i> published by Thomas Millington in 1594 and 1600), and <i>The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York</i> (the early version of <i>Henry VI, Part 3,</i> published by Millington in 1595 and 1600). In 1602, Pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from Millington.</li></ul><p><i>Pericles</i> was printed after <i>The Whole Contention</i>, since their signatures (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.) </p><p>As Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, he may also have lacked rights to Butter's <i>Lear</i> and Johnson's <i>Merry Wives</i>. There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the King's Men used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the ""Pavier quartos"" instead of the ""False Folio.""</p><p>Pollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary ""piracy,"" and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.</p>"	joined case his p initial lear odd significant villain after passionate about quarto john scholarly key couple shakespearean a on view few century remains vi wife title pavier that published such version occur attention pseudoshakespearean j richard windsor reproducing page copy innovation detailed it quartosin james intentionally of much see yorkshire 1600 millington text book commentator viewpoint run signature from sequence qualifier seventeenthcentury appeared false coloured fort single dream london take bibliographer debated also clear date 1609 contemporary three 1608 lancaster folger 1599 arthur jaggards york term 1621 oldcastle quire description connection used first bound contention format he just by v christian in corrected summary shakespeare washington robert have men university neidig valid acquired researcher approach william largerthanusual two pericles six stationer involved famous both publisher strictly attempt been since hayes not work printing applied during foliopollard 1619 merchant had concept for and demonstrated either between belonged unclear extant henry twentyfirst cast no contest why focused separately began who betwixt accurate true this or play did successor motivation dc bibliographic appearance only le 1612 necessity to be may role associate pollard vary longer question folio held almost nuanced merry q1 library collection whole wondered moral customer later is tragedy affair order piracy largecapacity existing shop worth johnson were issued midsummer right previously nicholas texas 1594 procedure special other printer t particular designation nathaniel ten second referring okes company venice 2 millingtonpericles 1623 possessed alphanumeric the year paviers primarily literary at but house choice night an butter canon earlier all however laurence duke instead one which major wa certainly 1602 miscellany pilgrim evokes ability provides king melodramatic examined state volume alfred scholar questionable sir 1595 start name with there therefore part reprinted thomas register lacked prince jaggard some previous – complete their subjective account print early twentieth w apparently modern greg together separate 3 tyre are effect attitude original more depending printed than collect nine matter five	group of books	book group of	Written_communication

First Folio	"<p><i><b>Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</b></i> is a collection of plays by William Shakespeare, commonly referred to by modern scholars as the <b>First Folio</b>, published in 1623, about seven years after Shakespeare's death. It is considered one of the most influential books ever published.</p><p>Printed in folio format and containing 36 plays (see list of Shakespeare's plays), it was prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues John Heminges and Henry Condell. It was dedicated to the ""incomparable pair of brethren"" William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and his brother Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke). </p><p>Although 19 of Shakespeare's plays had been published in quarto before 1623, the First Folio is arguably the only reliable text for about 20 of the plays, and a valuable source text for many of those previously published. Eighteen of the plays in the First Folio, including <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, and <i>Measure for Measure</i> among others, are not known to have been previously printed. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare's, with the exception of <i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i>, <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, <i>Edward III</i>, and the two lost plays, <i>Cardenio</i> and <i>Love's Labour's Won</i>. </p><p>Out of perhaps 750 copies printed, 235 are known to remain, most of which are kept in either public archives or private collections. </p>"	dedicated night 36 his or earl play 4th kept first generally twelfth 3rd death after ever only format noble about by exception quarto in john to all be mr shakespeare known have considered lost influential heminges before folio private a one which public most william wa colleague 750 two collection source pericles 20 won history pembroke later tempest includes is scholar tragedy 19 published been among many labour 235 commonly with edward copy brother valuable it not previously publishedprinted prince list reliable of remain see text including had book kinsman incomparable for and arguably those others either philip herbert eighteen modern prepared archive amp perhaps henry accepted iii out measure tyre containing 1623 although are printed montgomery the year love pair condell comedy seven cardenio referred	Collection of William Shakespeare's plays published in 1623	shakespeare collection william of in play 1623 published	Written_communication
Textual criticism	"<p><b>Textual criticism</b> is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and of literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants, or different versions, of either manuscripts or of printed books. Such texts may range in dates from the earliest writing in cuneiform, impressed on clay, for example, to multiple unpublished versions of a 21st-century author's work. Historically, scribes who were paid to copy documents may have been literate, but many were simply copyists, mimicking the shapes of letters without necessarily understanding what they meant. This means that unintentional alterations were common when copying manuscripts by hand. Intentional alterations may have been made as well, for example, the censoring of printed work for political, religious or cultural reasons. </p><p>The objective of the textual critic's work is to provide a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of the text and its variants. This understanding may lead to the production of a <b>critical edition</b> containing a scholarly curated text. If a scholar has several versions of a manuscript but no known original, then established methods of textual criticism can be used to seek to reconstruct the original text as closely as possible. The same methods can be used to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history, depending on the number and quality of the text available.</p><p>On the other hand, the one original text that a scholar theorizes to exist is referred to as the urtext (in the context of Biblical studies), archetype or autograph; however, there is not necessarily a single original text for every group of texts. For example, if a story was spread by oral tradition, and then later written down by different people in different locations, the versions can vary greatly. </p><p>There are many approaches or methods to the practice of textual criticism, notably eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, with methods from evolutionary biology (phylogenetics) appearing to be effective on a range of traditions.</p><p>In some domains, such as religious and classical text editing, the phrase ""lower criticism"" refers to textual criticism and ""higher criticism"" to the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text. </p>"	biblical phylogenetics quantitative this or practice used higher criticism determine mimicking spread authorship refers objective by archetype production in common to philology be may they hand scholarly however copyist scribe example known quality vary have composition exist religious seek simply a down better one on textual literate necessarily manuscript mean wa reconstruct approach eclecticism endeavor evolutionary urtext intentional oral paid history cultural same group later without is scholar when editing branch that phrase impressed such version document alteration copying been establish range many classical closely what greatly traditionsin written with there copy established critical variant clay were writing can witness number it work study not transcription unpublished creation some political 21stcentury of intermediate other critic identification text concerned book author method censoring availableon location for and people multiple either from if between theorizes place cuneiform reason several autograph tradition unintentional ha scholarship shape transmission technique single understanding possible made lower copytext relationship stemmatics earliest also date letter provide containing historically then context every recensions lead no are curated biology original depending printed domain the story appearing effective different meant historical notably well literary who but referred edition	branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism	textual and of branch scholarship literary criticism philology	Written_communication
Citation	<p>A <b>citation</b> is a reference to a source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. </p><p>Generally, the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). </p><p>Citations have several important purposes: to uphold intellectual honesty (or avoiding plagiarism), to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.</p><p>The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford, Harvard, MLA, NLM, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use. </p><p>Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgment by other authors of the priority of one's ideas. </p>	association term true spot intellectual appears or often determine uphold generally validity system an subscribe bibliographic apa compilation reference by entry fulfill in denotes section correct to form prior they material relevance avoiding known have considered american whereas these plagiarism expression a harvard one independently acknowledgment because source where gauge both sociological use asa referenced is each that convention citation idea such embedded constitutes mla what honesty themselves commonly abbreviated reader oxford widely combination it work not purpose deliberate precisely of thought spirit way other their allow usedthe help author strength inbody listlike body for advantage and others do whether several attribute ha easily important accepted editor priority syntactic psychological claimed argument support are bibliography specify more disadvantage alphanumeric discussion acknowledging the topic unoriginal interpreted at nlm	reference to a source	reference a source to	Written_communication

The object of a critical apparatus, as I conceive it, is to enable the earnest student to form his own text.

Stationers' Register	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Stationers' Register</b> was a record book maintained by the Stationers' Company of London. The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in England. The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of copyright law. The company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books. </p><p>For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—for the Elizabethan era, the Jacobean era, the Caroline era, and especially for English Renaissance theatre—the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the Master of the Revels (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.</p><p>By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work. One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and Nathaniel Butter claimed the right to print ""A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde."" (They paid sixpence.)</p><p>Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the companies of actors appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.</p><p>In 1710, the Copyright Act or Statute of Anne entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register. The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000. </p>"	never else appear case night his this or continued guild play lear 4 an publishing butter master fee certain posse pertaining christmas by profession in john express sainct to form all actor they 1607 shakespeare associated dramatic bookbinder information fact example regulate have entered provision nowhere trade before thorough supply playinge allowed various a reveals one which on sometimes wa england william vppon occurred servantes resource data statute itself elizabethan provides illicit ben stationer irregularity publisher essential 2000 charter paid kinge later immediate law historye without is registered scholar when superseding that published royal english document could banksyde revel many caroline with given constituted maiesties forestalling whitehall performance were record register work it right study not maintained purpose predecessor until some of 1710 hard booke stephen other printer vsually relate their anne renaissance into including registration book particular offer industry seize nathaniel for print early and 6 interestin force kinges through regulation modern 1557 november theatre—the bookseller 26 played last publication gave jonson globe company penny world london centuries—for jacobean sixteenth together february unlicensed claimed act also produce especially factual crucial busby sixpenceenforcement available yt copyright era cooperative contemporary rather printed than paying successorsby the called historical literature publish maiestie bar at seventeenth edition	record book of the Stationers' Company of London	london of stationer book record company the	Written_communication

Bluebook	"<p><i><b>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</b></i> is a style guide that prescribes the most widely used legal citation system in the United States. It is taught and used at a majority of U.S. law schools, and is also used in a majority of federal courts. There are also several ""house"" citation styles used by legal publishers in their works. <i>The Bluebook</i> is compiled by the <i>Harvard Law Review</i> Association, the <i>Columbia Law Review</i>, the <i>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</i>, and the <i>Yale Law Journal</i>. Currently, it is in its 21st edition (published July<span> </span>2020). Its name derives from the cover's color. </p><p>The Supreme Court uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their law clerks obtained their legal education at law schools that use <i>The Bluebook</i>. Furthermore, many state courts have their own citation rules that take precedence over the guide for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to <i>The Bluebook</i> system. Delaware's Supreme Court has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from its standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the Delaware Code also differs from it. In other states, the local rules are different from <i>The Bluebook</i> in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court. California has allowed citations in Bluebook as well as the state's own style manual, but many practitioners and courts continue recommending the <i>California Style Manual</i>.</p><p>An online-subscription version of <i>The Bluebook</i> was launched in 2008.

Printing and the Mind of Man	<p><i><b>Printing and the Mind of Man</b></i> is a book first published in 1967 and based on an exhibition in 1963. </p><p><i><b>PMM</b></i>, as it is usually abbreviated, is regarded as a standard bibliographical reference, and offers a survey of the impact of printed books on the development of western civilization. The book developed from an exhibition put on at two locations to coincide with the 1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition (IPEX). At the behest of typographer Stanley Morison it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at Earls Court concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the British Museum looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. Ian Fleming, who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition. The Fleming Collection so central to the exhibit is now at Indiana University.</p><p>The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of <i>PMM</i>) was printed by Oxford University Press, edited by John Carter, Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: <i>Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16–27 July 1963</i>. </p><p>A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at Cambridge University Press and published in 1967 by Cassell in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York.

Volumes are typically identified sequentially with Roman or Arabic numerals, e.g. ""volume 3"" or ""volume III"", commonly abbreviated to ""Vol."".</p><p>Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of multiple bound issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a periodical and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume.

A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an encyclopedia, or chapters, as in a monograph. </p><p>The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year or at the beginning of each term/semester. Likewise, a journal may start new volumes for each anniversary after its original inception. Thus, all issues published in the <i>N</i>th term or year will be classified under the <i>N</i>th volume.

Trondheim Airport, Jonsvatnet	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Trondheim Airport, Jonsvatnet</b> (Norwegian: <i lang=""no"">Trondheim sjøflyplass, Jonsvatnet</i>) was a water aerodrome located at Valset on the lake of Jonsvatnet in Trondheim, Norway. The airport was built as the first permanent airport serving Trondheim and initially was used for Norwegian Air Lines' (DNL) routes which commenced in 1935. Ahead of the 1936 season the airport was equipped with permanent installations, including wharfs and a small terminal building. In 1937 the airport was used by Widerøe, before DNL returned the following year. </p><p>During World War II the airport was taken over by the Luftwaffe, which used the ice on the lake as an airfield. Two aircraft which sank when the ice thawed were raised in 2004. Jonsvatnet was expanded and became a reserve airport for Trondheim Airport, Hommelvik, and Trondheim Airport, Ilsvika. After the war ended the airport was largely left unmaintained, but was variously used by DNL and later Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap as a reserve airport until 1957. The aviation club Trondheim Flyklubb reopened the airport in 1967 and remained there until 2013, when the airport was closed, since the airport's existence was incompatible with Jonsvatnet serving as the main source of drinking water for Trondheim. </p>"	war building 1935 existence over used line 2013 first season an 1936 returned after club route left sank by trondheim in luftfartsselskap before unmaintained valset ilsvika located a drinking aerodrome on which wa lake air luftwaffe two norwegian source wharf reserve taken later when terminal 1967 thawed ice permanent with there main airfield were expanded since installation became during aviation 1957 following until vestlandske of jonsvatnet norway airport 2004 ended including raised closed commenced for and incompatible ii widerøe built world serving 1937 ahead equipped largely flyklubb aircraft sjøflyplass small remained hommelvik water initially variously the year reopened at but dnl	airport in Trondheim, Norway	in norway airport trondheim	Airports
Oslo Airport location controversy	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The location of the main airport serving the city of Oslo, Norway, has been the subject of several political debates since 1918. The first controversy was initially related to choice between the islands of Gressholmen and Lindøya in the Oslofjord for a water aerodrome. The debate later changed, arriving at the decision in 1933, to locate a new airport at Fornebu. However, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, being located on a peninsula, proved to not have sufficient space for a runway capable of intercontinental aircraft and a second runway, resulting in plans from the 1960s to replace it. The main contestants were Gardermoen Air Station, Hurum, Hobøl, Ås and a split solution between Fornebu and Gardermoen. In 1992, parliament decided to build an all-new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen; when it opened in 1998, Fornebu was closed. The decision caused the southern parts of Eastern Norway to be moved further from the main airport, and the regional, privately owned Sandefjord Airport, Torp became the base for low-cost airlines. Moss Airport, Rygge opened in 2007, becoming the third simultaneous airport to serve Oslo, and closed in 2016. </p>"	hurum choice fornebu torp resulting first an 1998 changed lindøya 2016 hobøl lowcost in to be runway however space 2007 intercontinental moss opened have located a aerodrome on privately wa third contestant air decided further gardermoen solution proved arriving peninsula rygge new capable later being regional when build gressholmen 1918 becoming been 1933 base simultaneous main were part since 1992 it not became eastern political oslofjord controversy allnew of island debate plan norway airport owned subject airline serve split closed location for and sufficient from related moved between second several station 1960s ha oslo replace serving aircraft city water initially locate the caused ås parliament decision sandefjord southern at	long-running debate in Norway	in longrunning norway debate	Airports

Forty of the forty-five people on board the aircraft were killed, making it the deadliest civil aviation accident in Norway until Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 in 1996. According to Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet 23 December 1992, a Danish citizen died of late complications in 1976. </p><p>The pilots took a short-cut during approach on runway 06 at Fornebu.

There was a crew of four and eighty-six passengers on the Scandinavian Airlines System aircraft. </p><p>Upon arriving at Bulltofta at 17:14, the hijackers demanded the release of seven members of their group, which had been sentenced for the 1971 occupation of the Consulate-General of Yugoslavia in Gothenburg and shooting at the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Stockholm, including Miro Barešić. They threatened to otherwise detonate a bomb. Negotiations followed throughout the evening, night and morning. Six of the seven prisoners agreed to the transfer and were boarded at 04:00. Only a third of the hostages were released and new negotiations followed. All passengers were eventually released in exchange for half a million Swedish krona. </p><p>The aircraft then left for Madrid–Barajas Airport in Spain. There the aircraft was surrounded by the police and the crew released. The hijackers surrendered at 14:47. They were arrested and spent a year in prison in Spain.

Though air traffic was not heavy at LAX, as Flight 1493 was on final approach, the local controller was distracted by a series of abnormalities, including a misplaced flight progress strip and an aircraft that had inadvertently switched off the tower frequency. The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position, while the USAir flight was landing on the same runway. </p><p>Upon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engined turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as were an eventual total of 23 of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. Rescue workers were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the overwing exits. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to asphyxiation in the postcrash fire. </p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of situational awareness by the local controller, and inadequate oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers.<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: vi, 76"">: vi, 76 </span></sup> The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX. </p>"	found supervise strip continued used eventual died swearingen 1493 an directly traffic killed progress twinengined usable distracted only faa intense cause by 1 fairchild in while to all be form led runway however awareness 12 plane lax try accident collided a down approach on which one most wa upon air boeing because total neither 23 takeoff leading six 737300 metroliner series 89 overwing vi safety transportation 737 evening use final same occupant exited rescue that turboprop minute could manager beneath crash with evacuation worker angeles were off caught misplaced it not los probable aviation controller tower of switched local administration redundancy who flight procedure airport loss oversight control airline into including had told for and those people 5569 passenger front ntsb recommendation heavy within national usair frequency fire landing asphyxiation crushed abnormality february aboard 737s taxi smaller provided inadequate skywest aircraft scene international using exit failing board backlog situational three position the ntsbs succumbed different 1991 though caused postcrash 76 began federal at inadvertently	1991 runway collision between a USAir Boeing 737 and a SkyWest Metroliner at Los Angeles International Airport	at a 1991 angeles and runway metroliner international usair boeing los collision skywest between airport 737	Airports

The airport quickly became congested with parked airplanes blocking the only taxiway and forcing departing aircraft to taxi on the runway instead. Patches of thick fog were drifting across the airfield; hence visibility was greatly reduced for pilots and the control tower.</p><p>The subsequent investigation by Spanish authorities concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the KLM captain's decision to take off in the mistaken belief that a takeoff clearance from air traffic control (ATC) had been issued. Dutch investigators placed a greater emphasis on a mutual misunderstanding in radio communications between the KLM crew and ATC, but ultimately KLM admitted that their crew was responsible for the accident and the airline agreed to financially compensate the relatives of all of the victims.</p><p>The disaster had a lasting influence on the industry, highlighting in particular the vital importance of using standardized phraseology in radio communications.

Piccadilly line	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Piccadilly line</b> is a deep-level London Underground line running from the north to the west of London. It has two branches, which split at Acton Town, and serves 53 stations. The line serves Heathrow Airport, and some of its stations are near tourist attractions such as Piccadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace. The District and Metropolitan lines share some sections of tracks with the Piccadilly line. Printed in dark blue (officially ""Corporate Blue"", Pantone 072) on the Tube map, it is the fourth-busiest line on the Underground network with over 210 million passenger journeys in 2011/12. </p><p>The first section, between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith, was opened in 1906 as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The station tunnels and buildings were designed by Leslie Green, featuring ox-blood terracotta facades with semi-circular windows on the first floor. When Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL) took over the line, it was renamed the Piccadilly line. Subsequent extensions were made to Cockfosters, Hounslow West and Uxbridge in the early 1930s, when many existing stations on the Uxbridge and Hounslow branches were rebuilt to designs by Charles Holden, part of the Adams, Holden &amp; Pearson architectural practice. These were generally rectangular, with brick bases and large tiled windows, topped with a concrete slab roof. The western extensions took over existing District line services, which were fully withdrawn in 1964. </p><p>Stations in central London were rebuilt to cater for a higher volume of passenger traffic. To prepare for World War II, some stations were equipped with shelters and basic amenities; others were equipped with blast walls. Construction of the Victoria line, the first section of which was opened in 1968, helped to relieve congestion on the Piccadilly line, but some sections of the Piccadilly had to be rerouted for cross-platform interchange with the new line. Several plans were made to extend the Piccadilly line to serve Heathrow Airport. The earliest approval was given in 1967, and the Heathrow extension opened in stages between 1975 and 1977. This extension served only Terminals 2 and 3 and the former Terminal 1. The line was extended again twice, to Terminal 4 via a loop in 1986, and to Terminal 5 directly from the main terminal station in 2008. </p><p>This line has two depots, at Northfields and Cockfosters, with a group of sidings at several locations. Crossovers are at a number of locations, with some allowing for trains to switch onto different lines. The Piccadilly line once had its electricity generated from Lots Road Power Station. It was taken out of use in 2003; the line is now powered from the National Grid network. 1973 Stock is used on the tube line, where 78 of these are needed to have a 24 trains per hour (tph) (a train every <link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1020198016""><span role=""math"">2<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>2</span></span> minutes) service during peak hours.

Styal Line	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Styal line</b> is a suburban commuter railway line in the United Kingdom which runs through south Manchester and north-east Cheshire. It commences at Slade Lane Junction, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) south of Manchester Piccadilly, and runs 19 kilometres (12 mi) south to Wilmslow. </p><p>It was opened in 1909 by the London and North Western Railway company and takes its name from the Cheshire station of Styal, which is the last stop before the junction at Wilmslow. A branch line to Manchester Airport was built in 1993, accessed via a triangular junction between Heald Green and Styal. Consequently, it is also referred to as the <b>airport line</b>.</p><p>Patronage into Manchester on the eight commuter stations has risen sharply since the 1990s and the opening of the Manchester Airport railway station in 1993 fuelled an increase in express services from around Northern England and beyond. As a result, it is now one of the most congested lines on the National Rail network with services frequently susceptible to delays and cancellations.</p><p>Since May 2018 the line has operated on a skip-stop basis with each station having a dedicated 'express' service to Liverpool, Preston, Blackpool North and Windermere. This change was the result of congestion on this line and implemented to maximise the number of train slots (paths) between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport. However due to poor performance and falling patronage, it is proposed that the line will revert back to half hourly service calling at all stations, with one service terminating at Manchester Piccadilly and the other continuing on to Liverpool Lime Street.</p>"	dedicated beyond triangular sharply 1909 skipstop this junction line maximise windermere around north an fuelled lane delay united rail path about railway by in express to all may however cancellationssince opened 12 before having a one which on most wa england mi 2018 lime hourly blackpool suburban change manchester street heald linepatronage consequently slade is each piccadilly operated liverpool green 19 branch that eight revert kilometre poor name 1990s styal with commuter service kingdom northeast performance calling since south number it cheshire result falling increase of via due will airport other susceptible into risen opening congested congestion and stop run accessed from basis through between wilmslow station last built now national half ha preston back company london take 2 continuing also terminating commences slot frequently western 1993 the network proposed northern implemented train at referred patronage	railway line in  the UK	railway in uk line the	Airports

Casualism (art)	"<p><b>Casualism</b> is a 21st-century trend in art which uses color, composition, and balance to produce works with an unusual rather than obviously visually appealing appearance.</p><p>The term Casualism was coined in a 2011 essay which defined a new type of postminimalist painting that features a self-amused, anti-heroic style with an interest in off-kilter composition and impermanence. These artists are interested in a studied, passive-aggressive irresoluteness that reflect wider insights about culture and society Many artists responded positively to the essay and embraced the notion of Casualism, while others rejected the term, suggesting it whiffed of 'labelism' and 'crypto-institutionalism. The Casualist tendency continues to inform much work and conversation around American abstract painting.</p><p>Tatiana Berg, Joe Bradley, Sharon Butler, Amy Feldman, Keltie Ferris, Beth Letain, Lauren Luloff, Chris Martin, Rebecca Morris, David Ostrowski, Cordy Ryman, Michael Voss, and Molly Zuckerman-Hartung are painters who work in a Casualist mode.</p><p>In addition to Casualist, the term ""Provisional"" has been used to describe paintings that might appear unfinished or incomplete; work that is intentionally awkward, physically fragile and unstable, that reject the display of conventional skills, or that discover beauty in unassuming materials. However, Provisional painters, unlike the younger Casualists, suggest a kind of exhaustion, entertaining the impossibility of painting. The older artists whose work is considered Provisional include Raoul De Keyser, Michael Krebber, Mary Heilmann, Kimber Smith, Richard Tuttle and Christopher Wool.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1423 Cached time: 20220514171701 Cache expiry: 1814400 Reduced expiry: false Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.412 seconds Real time usage: 0.476 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1479/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 39669/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 427/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 11/100 Expensive parser function count: 2/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 42631/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.243/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 5706678/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 430.422 1 -total 47.42% 204.087 19 Template:Cite_web 15.64% 67.319 1 Template:Distinguish 12.16% 52.344 1 Template:Short_description 9.68% 41.666 2 Template:R 6.07% 26.139 2 Template:R/ref 5.79% 24.909 1 Template:Pagetype 5.18% 22.298 2 Template:Cite_book 3.25% 13.980 2 Template:Main_other 2.74% 11.773 2 Template:R/superscript -->"	appear term unstable positively painter or used around might reflect an rebecca display abstract suggest ryman michael letain whiffed joe keltie irresoluteness provisional society awkward about tendency unusual visually in while to appearancethe heilmann material however discover conversation composition paintingtatiana lauren luloff considered american these cordy a which artist wa bradley embraced defined unfinished 2011 offkilter raoul suggesting studied keyser beth include new wider describe ostrowski antiheroic is physically that fragile us postminimalist been richard many rejected beauty interested with impermanence obviously color martin coined addition reject older appealing it work zuckermanhartung modein insight berg unassuming passiveaggressive 21stcentury intentionally of notion casualism who krebber much type continues younger whose kind christopher style labelism cryptoinstitutionalism and incomplete others inform conventional ferris art ha painting interest trend exhaustion entertaining smith wool feldman produce voss impossibility are responded culture essay chris morris rather mary than skill unlike the butler sharon balance tuttle amy kimber david selfamused de casualists feature casualist molly	philosophical view	philosophical view	Artists

Sharon Butler	"<p><b>Sharon Butler</b> (born 1959) is an American artist and arts writer. She is known for teasing out ideas about contemporary abstraction in her art and writing, particularly a style she called ""new casualism"" in a 2011 essay. Butler uses process as metaphor and has said in artist's talks that she is keenly interested in creating paintings as documentation of her life. In a 2014 review in the <i>Washington Post</i>, art critic Michael Sullivan wrote that Butler ""creates sketchy, thinly painted washes that hover between representation and abstraction.Though boasting such mechanistic titles as 'Tower Vents' and 'Turbine Study,' Butler’s dreamlike renderings, which use tape to only suggest the roughest outlines of architectural forms, feel like bittersweet homages to urban decay."" Critic Thomas Micchelli proposed that Butler's work shares ""Rauschenberg’s dissolution of the barriers between painting and sculpture,"" particularly where the canvases are ""stapled almost willy-nilly to the front of the stretcher bars, which are visible along the edges of some of the works.""</p><p>Since 2016, her canvases have been based on small daily drawings that she made each day (2016-2020) in a phone app and posted on Instagram. In a 2018 conversation about the process of making paintings from these diminutive digital images, she said that the sense of surface and touch are inherent to a painting must be invented in the digital space. The images are never what they seem, especially when viewed on the phone."" Critic Laurie Fendrich called Butler's work ""beautiful and grittily compelling,"" suggesting in a 2021 review that her brushwork and color come out of her earlier casualist approach.The paintings ""feel slightly off-balance, but not so much that they’re ugly.

Fred G. Johnson	"<p><b>Fred G. Johnson</b> (January 1892, Chicago, Illinois – 11 May 1990, Sun City, Arizona) was a prolific sideshow banner artist whose career spanned 65 years. His banner paintings were displayed at the Chicago World's Fair of 1933, called <i>A Century of Progress</i>, and by circuses such as Ringling Brothers, Barnum &amp; Bailey, and Clyde Beatty. He has been called the ""Picasso"" of circus art.</p><p>Fred Johnson, one of nine boys in a Chicago family, was employed at age 14 as an errand boy by the United States Tent &amp; Awning Co. of Chicago, but was soon dismissed for neglecting his work to play baseball. He was hired by banner painter Harry Carlton Cummins to clean equipment and tack up banners. Cummins also taught him to paint banners, though he never received any formal art training. Johnson resumed working for the United States Tent &amp; Awning Co. after World War I, producing banners for owners Walter and Charles Driver between 1921 and 1930.</p><p>Sideshow and circus banners first appeared in Europe during the early 1800s. Hung outside shows or booths, they served the same function as that of decorative shop signs, advertising the contents within. At the height of their popularity from the 1870s to the late 1960s, sideshow banners were strung up at carnivals and traveling shows throughout the world. Early circuses routinely used brightly painted ones to lure paying customers to their quirky sideshows of freaks and curiosities – snake charmers, sword swallowers, two-headed babies and five-legged cows were some of the exaggerated attractions offered for 'your shock and amazement for just five cents!'. Circus banners were usually about 8 feet (2.4 m) high, but commissions could be any size. The largest Johnson ever produced was 50 feet (15 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) ""for a bughouse"" which took him about 40 hours. On average, however, he turned out four a day. He also painted the side-panels on circus trailers and merry-go-rounds.</p><p>Charles Driver later started his own business, taking Johnson with him. When it went bankrupt, Johnson continued to paint banners in a garage on Chicago's northwest side. Undaunted, Driver joined the O. Henry Tent &amp; Awning Co., persuading Johnson to follow him. Johnson worked for that company for some 40 years from 1934 to 1974. </p><p>He later retired at the age of 89 and moved to Sun City, Arizona. He passed away May 11, 1990 at the age of 98. He was survived by son Ellsworth, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p><p>Most of his banners were lost, but survivors are preserved in circus museums in Baraboo, Wisconsin – home to Ringling Brothers – and Sarasota, Florida. as well as in the Carl Hammer gallery. Some were auctioned by Sotheby's in 1981, with titles such as ""Minnie Ha-Ha the Monkey Girl"" and ""Dickie the Penguin Boy"". In July 1989, the State of Illinois Art Center Gallery had an exhibit of his work. His works were subsequently shown by the Rockford Art Museum in 1991, which showcased “Fat Man”, an early work that had not been displayed prior. In an episode of the television show <i>American Pickers</i>, pickers Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz purchased two banners, one of which appraiser William Leroy later identified as being by Johnson. Though not in the best of shape, the pair were valued at $10,000. </p> "	episode never war average joined walter “ painter 1800s undaunted his or 65 boy used continued play employed fred him persuading clean florida advertising penguin wisconsin first served northwest an throughout cow four commission banner progress after lure ever survived 46 neglecting he united ellsworth driver home just about taught by bailey sidepanels in painted to cent be decorative may they charles 1934 however ” prior errand appraiser 1930sideshow lost preserved follow museum leroy american snake charmer baseball curiosity twoheaded freak any a 1921 one which artist on wa barnum swallowers 40 william displayed up foot greatgrandchildrenmost two girl family january century 1870s o resumed 89 1892 sign late state usually picasso customer same later brightly being monkey title when harry co that rockford such career training 14 trailer showcased could outside m been clyde tack july 1933 working valued with sarasota shop carlton brother son center johnson 1974 exhibit were cummins baraboo fritz it work received not content gallery sothebys fat mike during your attraction some started of own owner 8 – bughouse minnie g paint exaggerated 50 fair equipment function strung 15 traveling merrygoroundscharles side their 11 baby fivelegged beatty business had hammer whose offered shock amazement awning illinois prolific ringling circus for popularity quirky taking 10000 early 1990 and largest took carnival auctioned bankrupt produced from survivor moved passed between hour picker man appeared identified day tent within art haha 1960s television ha painting sun amp shape show best routinely soon henry booth size out world garage went company dismissed retired hired europe sword also 24 purchased frank 98 formal city 1981 age are sideshow arizona turned shown grandchild spanned three artfred hung paying the worked nine year height pair called though producing away carl 1989 i 1991 wolfe five well high at but subsequently dickie chicago	American artist (1892-1990)	18921990 artist american	Artists

Eltono	"<p><b>Eltono</b> is a French artist born in the suburbs of Paris in 1975. His work is mostly influenced by his graffiti background. He started painting around 1989 in his neighborhood mostly on train tracks and highway walls. ""Eltono focused mainly on the railway lines to the northwest of the city, painting in the traditional silver and black, block letter Parisian style."" He lived in Madrid from 1999 to 2010 (where he got his pseudonym), then in Beijing from 2010 to 2014 and since 2014 lives in the south of France. In 1999, while living in Madrid, he started painting abstract symbols with tape and acrylic paint. ""It was then that he developed the colorful geometric box patterns for which he is now known."" ""As Eltono himself suggested, his move away from traditional graffiti was produced so as to find a harmony with both the material and the social body of the city (integrating both its architectonic and societal elements in a more consensual manner)."" ""Eltono also rejects conventional letterforms in favor of a minimalism device with which to negotiate space.""</p><p>Eltono's work is mainly influenced by the urban environment and questions the limits between public and private space. He uses the term ""public space artist"" to describe his practice. When showing his work in galleries and museums, he focuses on finding a coherent way to show street art in private spaces. ""[Eltono's] career in both the street and the galleries [], is an example of a certain ethic of sustained work, oblivious to everything, which creates its own parameters and builds its own audience.""</p><p>He has collaborated with artists such as MOMO (artist), Nuria Mora (http://nuriamora.com/), Luce and is part of Equipo Plástico art collective (alongside Nuria Mora, Nano4814 and Sixeart) and Noviciado9 (alongside 3ttman, Remed, Spok, Nano4814 and Luciano Suarez). </p>"	pseudonym term 2010 his practice line around northwest an harmony collective abstract suggested he certain urban track lived silver eltonos by railway in while to geometric sustained material symbol space eltono known example everything question museum creates noviciado9 3ttman limit device private a environment on artist which public wa pattern influenced integrating luce himself nuria remed where background both block parameter spaceeltonos tape societal describe luciano is when 2014 that build france such career wall us focus acrylic favor with life reject part since south mora it work gallery got madrid httpnuriamoracom started neighborhood living box coherent of oblivious own suburb showing collaborated spok finding developed paint way audiencehe minimalism architectonic graffiti equipo alongside for style highway body beijing suarez and plástico produced from ethic paris colorful between conventional letterforms now so element art manner black 1975 negotiate 1999 painting ha sixeart show born nano4814 traditional parisian also letter then city momo french mainly more mostly move consensual the focused find away 1989 train street social	French artist	french artist	Artists
Malina Suliman	"<p><b>Malina Suliman,</b> a graffiti artist, metalworker, and painter, was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1990. As a child, she and her family were forced to flee her home province to live in Kandahar, Afghan. Her work is considered to challenge traditional Muslim culture like the burqa. According to Suliman, ""The burqa is a way of controlling, but in the name of respect. Every culture or religion gives a different name for the burqa. It is honor, culture, and religion. Really, it just controls the woman and keeps her inside."" Malina's work has gained the attention of the Taliban and traditional Muslims, resulting in having received threats from the Taliban towards Suliman and her family. The artist was subject to physical threats, rocks have been thrown at her as she conducts her work.</p><p>Not only does Malina worry about the Taliban, but her family who disagrees with her decision to create art. Writing art that that displays the human body like Malina's motif, the skeleton in a burqa, is seen as idol worship. To the Taliban and other traditional Muslims, Malina's artwork is un-Islamic and Suliman's parents were embarrassed.

In der Maur	<p><b>In der Maur</b> (also written as <b>In der Mauer</b>, <b>Indermaur</b>, <b>Indermauer</b>) is an ancient Swiss family. Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the family held positions of political and economic power as members of the bourgeoisie in Berneck, St. Gallen and as members of the lower nobility in Kurtatsch an der Weinstraße. The In der Maur von Berneck family were first granted a coat of arms in 1478, when Hermann In der Maur was appointed as the Ammann of the Abbot of St. Gallen of Berneck— a position the family continued to hold throughout the reigns of the Prince-Abbots of the Abbey of Saint Gall within the Holy Roman Empire. Members of the family also served as Imperial tax collectors and as clerks of the Court of Berneck. The first member of the family to hold the position of Ammann in Berneck was Ulrich In der Maur in 1435. </p><p>After Hans Indermaur von Berneck settled in Rheineck in 1590, the family were granted fiefdoms as vassals, and owned vineyards in the region. A coat of arms was granted to the In der Maur von Rheineck family in 1685, first used by Johann In der Maur. Members of this branch also served as magistrates and clerks of the Courts of Rheineck. </p><p>A branch of the family that settled in South Tyrol were granted coats of arms in 1479, 1491 and 1586. They were elevated to the lower nobility by Rudolf II in 1601 and were then known as von In der Maur auf Strehlburg und zu Freifeld, after their two principle estates in Tyrol: Ansitz Strehlburg and Ansitz Freienfeld. A descendant of this branch, Josef Sebastian Anton Indermauer von Freifeld zu Strelburg, was ennobled in the Kingdom of Bavaria by Maximilian I Joseph in 1813. </p><p>Members of the family have been leading figures in politics, law, and statesmanship including Carl von In der Maur, who served as Governor of Liechtenstein under Johann II, Ignaz Anton von Indermauer, who served as Landvögte of Vorarlberg, Gilbert von In der Maur, who was a Nazi official in Austria, and John Indermaur, who was a solicitor and legal writer in the United Kingdom.

Reservoir (Rauschenberg)	<p><i><b>Reservoir</b></i> is a 1961 painting by American artist Robert Rauschenberg. The work is one of his Combines, which incorporate both two- and three-dimensional found, non-art materials, using objects Rauschenberg collected from the streets of his lower Manhattan neighborhood. <i>Reservoir</i> is in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, in Washington, D.C. According to the museum, the artwork incorporates a length of wood, two clocks, and two cast-off wheels which evoke the always changing and surprising contrasts of everyday experience. The seemingly spontaneous arrangement of objects and the quick, gestural brushstrokes evoke the legacy of Abstract Expression.

It was created in 1953 when Rauschenberg erased a drawing he obtained from the Abstract Expressionist and American artist Willem de Kooning. Rauschenberg's friend and fellow artist, Jasper Johns, later framed it in a gilded frame and added a written caption to mimic the framing style of the Royal Academy and monogramming found on Renaissance drawings and prints. The caption reads: ""Erased de Kooning Drawing, Robert Rauschenberg, 1953.” It has been in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) since 1998.

The members included Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Édouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Félix Vallotton, Paul Sérusier and Auguste Cazalis. Most were students at the Académie Julian in Paris in the late 1880s. The artists shared a common admiration for Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne and a determination to renew the art of painting, but varied greatly in their individual styles. They believed that a work of art was not a depiction of nature, but a synthesis of metaphors and symbols created by the artist. In 1900, the artists held their final exhibition and went their separate ways.</p>"	roussel individual impressionism félix vallotton renew abstract ranson le bonnard by active in common to they symbol large held depiction a artist student most young wa julian shared 1880s nabi included late pierre modernism final group that pronunciation édouard greatly sérusier kerxavier ​le maurice were part transition work not until nabis of who nature gauguin other way their for style exhibition early and determination movement believed 1900 from vuillard paris denis academic paul cézanne played art painting académie symbolism member admiration 1888 went varied separate french metaphor auguste the cazalis synthesis at but created	artist collective	artist collective	Artists

Painters invited include Camille Pissarro (1887, 1889, 1891), Claude Monet (1886, 1889), Georges Seurat (1887, 1889, 1891, 1892), Paul Gauguin (1889, 1891), Paul Cézanne (1890), and Vincent van Gogh (1890, 1891 retrospective). </p><p><i>Les XX</i> was in some ways a successor to another group, L'Essor.

Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood </b> (later known as the <b>Pre-Raphaelites</b>) was a group of English painters, poets, and art critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner who formed a seven-member ""Brotherhood"" modelled in part on the Nazarene movement. The Brotherhood was only ever a loose association and their principles were shared by other artists of the time, including Ford Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes and Marie Spartali Stillman. Later followers of the principles of the Brotherhood included Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris and John William Waterhouse. </p><p>The group sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian art. They rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name ""Pre-Raphaelite"". In particular, the group objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called ""Sir Sloshua"". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, ""sloshy"" meant ""anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind"". The group associated their work with John Ruskin, an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background. Christian themes were abundant.</p><p>The group continued to accept the concepts of history painting and mimesis, imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, <i>The Germ</i>, to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the <i>Pre-Raphaelite Journal</i>. The Brotherhood separated after almost five years.</p>"	association corrupting spartali painter his or millais continued joshua first brown reynolds whom an reform mechanistic promote after ever michael only waterhouse michelangelo intense by ruskin christian in john marie burnejones to form they journal gabriel associated rossetti ford scamped known composition germ lax everett religious almost any a time complex approach on artist wa william hence loose defined shared sloshy sought theme background formed succeeded pose included raphael distinct madox academy history abundant dante later group colour elegant mimesis published sir nazarene royal according english sevenmember idea quattrocento been anything classical rejected what name themselves with return edward adopted part were mannerist thomas work italian purpose collinson process teaching modelled james of woolner 1848 nature founded debate follower stephen other stillman critic their influence sloshua including had particular periodical whose frederic kind principle concept abundantthe founder for regarded and movement believed academic george accept conventional holman art hunt painting imitation commonplace recorded brotherhood central driven hughes person preraphaelites preraphaelite separated thing morris the year detail meant called five objected arthur who created poet	group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848	critic group and of painter in 1848 founded poet english	Artists
Vienna Secession	"<p>The <b>Vienna Secession</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Wiener Secession</i>; also known as <i>the Union of Austrian Artists</i>, or <i>Vereinigung Bildender Künstler Österreichs</i>) is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles. Their most influential architectural work was the Secession Building designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich as a venue for expositions of the group. Their official magazine was called <i>Ver Sacrum</i> (<i>Sacred Spring</i>, in Latin), which published highly stylised and influential works of graphic art. In 1905 the group itself split, when some of the most prominent members, including Klimt, Wagner, and Hoffmann, resigned in a dispute over priorities, but it continued to function, and still functions today, from its headquarters in the Secession Building.

Hogarth Club	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Hogarth Club</b> was an exhibition society of artists, based at 84 Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia, London, UK, which existed between 1858 and 1861. It was founded by former members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood after the original PRB had been dissolved. It was envisaged that the club would provide an alternative meeting space and exhibition venue to overcome prejudice against the Pre-Raphaelites at the Royal Academy. Unlike the PRB, the Hogarth Club was established on a professional basis, with two classes of members, artistic and non-artistic, and a distinction between London-based ""resident"" and provincial ""non-resident"" members. </p><p>Ford Madox Brown suggested that the club be named after William Hogarth since Hogarth was ""a painter whom he deeply reverenced as the originator of moral invention and drama in modern art"". Brown and Dante Gabriel Rossetti had worked on some previous independent exhibitions, but became determined to form a permanent exhibition space after the rejection of Pre-Raphaelite work by the Academy in 1857. In response they created their own exhibition, later founding the Hogarth Club in tandem with other sympathetic artists, most notably William Holman Hunt and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope.</p><p>Despite initial success, the Hogarth Club failed to maintain its momentum, and was finally closed in 1861 after failing to adequately build up its membership in the face of hostility from the Royal Academy.

National Institution of Fine Arts	"<p> The <b>National Institution of Fine Arts</b> was a short-lived Victorian-era art society founded in London to provide alternative exhibition space for artists. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown notably exhibited there. </p><p>The organisation began as the ""<b>Institution for the Free Exhibition of Modern Art</b>"" in 1847 (""<b>Free Exhibition</b>"" for short), and mounted shows from 1848–49 in a temporary building known as ""St. George's Gallery"" on Knightsbridge (road), next to Hyde Park, London. Its purpose was stated in an 1848 catalogue, ""Freedom for the Artist, certainty of Exhibition for his works, and the Improvement of the Public Taste."" The society then changed its name to the ""<b>National Institution of Fine Arts</b>"" (""<b>National Institution</b>"" for short) and from 1850–61 exhibited works at the old Portland Gallery at 316 Regent Street. </p><p>The National Institution aimed to provide a less-restrictive and more equitable alternative to the established exhibitions at places like the Royal Academy. The organisers allocated space by lottery, so there was no favouritism, allowed artists more control over the display of their pictures, and space was cheaper — making it more accessible to women artists who suffered discrimination by other exhibiting bodies. The exhibition was ""free"" in the sense that any artist was welcome to exhibit. </p><p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti exhibited his first major oil painting, <i>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i>, at the Free Exhibition in March 1849, and in April 1850 <i>Ecce Ancilla Domini</i> at the National Institution.

Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the Salon d'Automne. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. World War I brought a closure to the salon, though the <i>Artistes Indépendants</i> remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters has been located in the vast basements of the Grand Palais (next door to the <i>Société des Artistes Français</i>, the <i>Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts</i>, the Société du Salon d'Automne, and others). </p>"	association 29 war salon vast odilon choosing récompense this or annual often 20th headquarters first grand decade society door active in to beauxarts 1884 indépendants located a on artist wa displayed next century where formed français basement 1920 without is dautomne jury set palais july among been artiste with widely nor were since sans it following albert of independent their nationale discussed exhibition founder for early and slogan others paris paul george massive société brought art ha signac ni closure world trend artwork redon organization reward remained seurat three du duboispillet the along though i began de	French artists' salon and exhibiting space	salon french artist and exhibiting space	Artists
Ancients (art group)	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>The Ancients</b> (also known as the <b>Shoreham Ancients</b>) were a group of young English artists and others who were brought together around 1824 by their attraction to archaism in art and admiration for the work of William Blake (1757–1827), who was a generation or two older than the group. The core members of the Ancients were Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the Royal Academy of Arts. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the ""House of Interpreter"" and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the Kent village of Shoreham. The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century. </p><p>They were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic ""brotherhood"", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German Nazarene movement and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world. Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both National Portrait Gallery), which shows a round-necked pleated smock under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard. The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.</p>"	calvert house hair collar costume this or archaism richmond continued often barbu represented practice smock around first except significant an like village miniature only home society by in general to all be samuel they oppositional breakaway chalk known example have aim little past these interpreter beard a bustlength aware on artist student most young william wa gradually which loose generation two formalised successful establishment hierarchical vision revivalist included both met combined late drawing academy increased group later roundnecked structure promotion promoted that nazarene royal such english untidy version portrait among with edward impact german probably 1757–1827 were older since it work not continental gallery manifestation during looked attraction some living pursued of who special core long idealized their palmer artistic whose reaction seems coat for lapel and ten 1829 under movement somewhat others from paris academic george christlike sort conventional several brought so element art national ha equality kent show admiration member interest back world made together brotherhood communal central 19thcentury worn also shoreham ancient preraphaelite 1824 scene apartment wearing shown than the year blake though dubbed pleated at but	group of English artists who admired William Blake	group blake artist william of who admired english	Artists

Bande noire (art)	<p>The <b>Bande noire</b> (Black Band) was a group of French painters of the 1890s who used a darker and richer palette than most of their Impressionist contemporaries, aiming for a stylistic fusion of Impressionism with the raw or melancholy realism associated with painters such as Gustave Courbet.

Sun Ra	"<p><b>Le Sony'r Ra</b> (born <b>Herman Poole Blount</b>, May 22, 1914 – May 30, 1993), better known as <b>Sun Ra</b>, was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, ""cosmic"" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led ""The Arkestra"", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. </p><p>Born and raised in Alabama, Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Le Sony'r Ra, shortened to Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian god of the Sun). Claiming to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. Throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying, ""Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym.""</p><p>His widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz, from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz, to swing music, bebop, free jazz and fusion. His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians, along with electronic excursions, songs, chants, percussion pieces, and anthems. From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra (which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations). Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age. Following Ra's illness-forced retirement in 1992, the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra, and, as of 2021, continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen.</p><p>Though his mainstream success was limited, Sun Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer, and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona. He is now widely considered an innovator; among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Over the course of his career, he recorded dozens of singles and over one hundred full-length albums, comprising well over 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century.</p>"	band 1914 chant echoed his over often costume philosophy frequent him bandleader 20th innovator cosmic an throughout performing collective death after fusion synthesizer le he swing by active bebop iteration making in abandoned john led to output be prior may hot gilmore tyson space shortened known 1940s composition album considered influential american song any a various better one on which artist piece wa 1000 most piano retirement comprising marshall denied egyptian 22 ranged 2021 blount century experimental involved claiming keyboard included success dozen peace late use new history leadership musical mainstream is lineup player that veteran such career identity flexible futuristic limited among course herman name eclectic with arkestra life widely improvisation god performance attire allen june 1992 birth it became work recording during until following solo mythical of musician fulllength much – developed sideman other persona ra continues modal ragtime composer avantgarde preach raised electronic 30 prolific for taking early and saying free under dressed pioneering from alabama ensemble hundred featured inspired tie pioneer alien credo idiosyncratic now distinction performer sun saturn soon single everchanging pseudonymhis born music made orleans afrofuturism recorded elaborate entire ancient remained jazz anthem age scene are mission sonyr poole illnessforced mid1950s than 1993 the excursion along i theatrical well dancer allenthough live poet big percussion chicago	American jazz composer and bandleader (1914–1993)	jazz 1914–1993 and composer american bandleader	Artists

Frida Kahlo	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096""> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[ˈfɾiða ˈkalo]</span>; 6 July 1907 – 13 July 1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary <i>Mexicayotl</i> movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.</p><p>Born to a German father and a <i>mestiza</i> mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoacán – now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum. Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems. During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist. </p><p>Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together. During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs. Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist André Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, <i>The Frame</i>, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection. Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher. She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (""<i>La Esmeralda</i>"") and was a founding member of the <i>Seminario de Cultura Mexicana</i>. Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade. She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47. </p><p>Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists. By the early 1990s, not only had she become a recognized figure in art history, but she was also regarded as an icon for Chicanos, the feminism movement, and the LGBTQ+ movement. Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1412 Cached time: 20220513032405 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.536 seconds Real time usage: 0.672 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 2716/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 32875/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 6500/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 18/100 Expensive parser function count: 8/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 13002/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.341/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 7701081/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 1/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 645.255 1 -total 45.98% 296.715 1 Template:Infobox_person 42.18% 272.148 1 Template:Infobox 19.23% 124.106 3 Template:Cite_web 15.96% 102.994 2 Template:Marriage 15.40% 99.380 5 Template:Br_separated_entries 12.13% 78.270 1 Template:Birth_date 9.76% 62.946 1 Template:Short_description 8.77% 56.595 1 Template:Str_≠_len 8.30% 53.555 1 Template:Wdib -->"	grabado york described coyoacán kahlo painter rivera this often surrealist or levy worked pintura employed married publicly breton artifact rediscovered first an throughout childhood fantasy returned death taught relatively le class united only home decade 13 society 1927 fellow belief mexico about mexican by 1930s frame making naïve in injured pain calderón her to realism led mixed painted mother bus while be form accessible explore communist known 1940s question museum couple disabled before feminist historian 1920s join mestiza accident depiction a time indigenous which artist student most wa spent azul postcolonialism 1929 1938 alwaysfragile lgbtq sought precolumbian successful family collection 18 1953 success met father late state drawing new history same being is 1907 when spanish internationally that idea pronunciation identity becoming portrait july been la many y what 1939 escultura founding with 1990s child life main german frida seen addition it work not gallery autobiographical during until female solo participated health political school of feminism nature who activist – nacional developed their chronic andré strong had artistic lifelong esmeralda catholic diego mexicana celebrated politics raised kahlos define for style exhibition popular gender decline early inspiration and regarded movement 6 from recognized paris escuela she medical through inspired louvre featured emblematic icon postrevolutionary now element art national 1970s tradition ha painting another ˈfɾiða promising member interest teacher adult mexicayotl realist together 47 headed also uncompromising 1954 magdalena polio party although purchased small remained age julien culture french shortly carmen experience magical chicano race travelling followed mostly seminario the country problem arranged become recovery figure caused cultura ˈkalo folk painborn belonging de began at but selfportraits unknown casa	Mexican painter	mexican painter	Artists

He won a contest in 1970 to build the Bella Vista Golf Club in México City, and from there on he had a successful career. At the end of the 1970s he became a strong supporter of Postmodern architecture and claimed to be a follower of the internationally acclaimed Mexican architect Luis Barragán. His buildings became then a mixture of traditional Mexican and modern architecture. Rocha Diaz built in that period important works such as: the SACM recording studios (the first ones in Latin America capable of having a full orchestra with choir), the SACM cinemas that later became the Cineteca Nacional de México, the conventions center in Morelia México, etc. In 1988 he became numbered academic from the Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos.

NASA Astronaut Group 8	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>NASA Astronaut Group 8</b> was a group of 35 astronauts announced on January 16, 1978.

The class was the first to include female and minority astronauts; of the 35 selected, six were women, one of them being Jewish American, three were African American, and one was Asian American. Due to the long delay between the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972 and the first flight of the Space Shuttle in 1981, few astronauts from the older groups remained, and they were outnumbered by the newcomers, who became known as the Thirty-Five New Guys (TFNG). Since then, a new group of candidates has been selected roughly every two years. </p><p>In Astronaut Group 8, two different kinds of astronaut were selected: pilots and mission specialists. The group consisted of 15 pilots, all test pilots, and 20 mission specialists. NASA stopped sending non-pilots for one year of pilot training. It also ceased appointing astronauts on selection. Instead, starting with this group, new selections were considered astronaut candidates rather than fully-fledged astronauts until they finished their training. </p><p>Four members of this group, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, and Ronald McNair, died in the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> disaster. These four, plus Shannon Lucid, received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, giving this astronaut class five total recipients of this top NASA award. This is second only to the New Nine class which received seven. The careers of the TFNGs would span the Space Shuttle Program.

Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott. </p><p>Hal Jordan is a former combat pilot who works for Ferris Aircraft as a test pilot, a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps, as well as a founding member of the Justice League, DC's flagship superhero team, alongside well-known heroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers, but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814, which is the sector where Earth resides. His powers derive from his power ring and Green Lantern battery, which in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear allows the user to channel their will power into creating all manner of fantastic constructs. Jordan uses this power to fly, even through the vacuum of space; to create shields, swords, and lasers; and to construct his Green Lantern costume, which protects his secret identity in his civilian life on Earth. Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious Guardians of the Universe, who were developed from an idea editor Julius Schwartz and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring Captain Comet in <i>Strange Adventures #22</i> (July 1952) entitled ""Guardians of the Clockwork Universe"".</p><p>During the 1990s, Jordan also appeared as a villain. The story line <i>Emerald Twilight</i> saw a Jordan traumatized by the supervillain Mongul's destruction of Jordan's hometown Coast City, adopt the name ""Parallax"", and threaten to destroy the universe. In subsequent years, DC Comics rehabilitated the character, first by having Jordan seek redemption for his actions as Parallax, and later by revealing that Parallax was in fact an evil cosmic entity that corrupted Jordan and took control of his actions. Between the character's stint as Parallax and his return to DC Comics as a heroic Green Lantern once more, the character also briefly served as the Spectre, a supernatural character in DC Comics stories who acts as God's wrathful agent on Earth. </p><p>Outside of comics, Hal Jordan has appeared in various animated projects, video games and live-action. Jordan's original design in the comics was based on actor Paul Newman, and the character is ranked 7th on IGN's in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.

He fights evil with the aid of a magical ring which grants him a variety of powers.

After debuting in <i>All-American Comics</i>, Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, <i>Green Lantern</i>. Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of ""mystery men"" or superheroes in comic books. </p><p>Following World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After eight years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC revisited Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were Green Lanterns on two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Later stories set on Earth-Two depicted Alan becoming the father to the superheroes Obsidian and Jade, each with powers somewhat like his own. In 1985, DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, merging Earth-One and Earth-Two and re-establishing Alan as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, coexisting with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. </p><p>In 2011, DC's New 52 introduced a new Multiverse, depicting a young Earth-Two version of Alan who was an out gay man.

William Shatner	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>William Alan Shatner</b> (born March 22, 1931) is a Canadian actor. In a career spanning seven decades, he is best known for his portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk of the USS <i>Enterprise</i> in the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise; from the second pilot in 1965 to his final appearance as Kirk in <i>Star Trek Generations</i> (1994). </p><p>Shatner began his screen acting career in Canadian films and television productions before moving into guest-starring roles in various US television shows. He appeared as Captain Kirk in all the episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>, 21 of the 22 episodes of <i>Star Trek: The Animated Series</i>, and the first seven <i>Star Trek</i> movies. He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk, being a part of <i>Star Trek</i>, and life after <i>Star Trek</i>. He has also co-written several novels set in the <i>Star Trek</i> universe and a series of science fiction novels called <i>TekWar</i> that were adapted for television. Outside <i>Star Trek,</i> Shatner played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in <i>T. J. Hooker</i> (1982–1986) and hosted the reality-based television series <i>Rescue 911</i> (1989–1996), which won a People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series.

Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa	<p><i><b>Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa</b></i> is a 2002 musical animated Christmas special. It is one of two films produced by Colin Slater's Wolf Tracer Studios. Featuring the voices of Walter Emanuel Jones, Mark Hamill, Jodi Benson, Paige O'Hara and Nancy Cartwright, <i>Believe in Santa</i> tells the story of how suburban boy Ricky Rodgers and his friends spend Christmas after the death of Ricky's mother. </p><p><i>Believe in Santa</i> was broadcast throughout December in broadcast syndication in the top 100 markets, though its most prevalent distribution was through The WB 100+ Station Group, which broadcast The WB over cable and broadcast stations in smaller markets (it did not air on The WB itself as part of its primetime schedule). The special is notable for its production history and overwhelmingly negative reception. Almost every aspect of the special was panned, including its low-quality and ugly looking computer animation and amateur plot, although the voice acting received some minor praise. After a small number of broadcasts during the 2002 holiday season, the special was never officially released on home video and faded into obscurity. A copy of the special was secured from producer and director Colin Slater and uploaded onto the video sharing site Vimeo in 2015. It later garnered a cult following. </p>	never walter his over kid boy tracer colin did minor market onto season rodgers throughout plot death after nancy home christmas director jones by ohara production in schedule reception syndication producer mother broadcast mark garnered lowquality holiday panned almost a believe one hamill which on most wa aspect air suburban two praise itself history musical group later uploaded is santa december released prevalent animation copy site acting how animated emanuel part ricky faded negative number it not received voice during following some slater tell of cable notable special primetime 100 jodi into cult including rapsittie secured friend for and produced from through distribution 2002 cartwright obscurity station overwhelmingly officially looking wolf top spend wb smaller ugly although every small studio vimeo featuring 2015 film amateur the story rickys though video computer sharing benson street paige	2002 American television special	american 2002 television special	Building
Patch Town (2014 film)	<p><i><b>Patch Town</b></i> is a 2014 Canadian dark fantasy comedy holiday film written by Christopher Bond and Jessie Gabe, and directed by Craig Goodwill. Originally a short film that inspired a much larger project, <i>Patch Town</i> stars actors Rob Ramsay, Julian Richings, Zoie Palmer, Suresh John, Stephanie Pitsiladis and Ken Hall in a quasi-musical about a fictional Soviet-style factory producing children's toys, run by a bitter and lonely executive officer named Yuri (Richings). When a factory employee named Jon (Ramsay) discovers a hidden secret about his past, he goes on a quest of trying to establish a real family for himself. Completed in 2014 and released in 2015, <i>Patch Town</i> received mixed reviews, but was praised for the cast's acting and the story's satirically grim take on United States 1980s consumer culture, and Soviet communism.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1343 Cached time: 20220514222351 Cache expiry: 3600 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.271 seconds Real time usage: 0.349 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1024/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 17220/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2688/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 24/100 Expensive parser function count: 3/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 4503/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.159/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3785140/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 335.626 1 -total 33.45% 112.280 1 Template:Infobox_film 28.24% 94.786 2 Template:Cite_web 27.49% 92.277 1 Template:Infobox 23.90% 80.208 1 Template:Short_description 13.12% 44.049 1 Template:Pagetype 11.48% 38.546 1 Template:Missing_information 10.35% 34.726 7 Template:Main_other 9.47% 31.781 1 Template:Ambox 5.15% 17.298 1 Template:Film_date -->	larger rob secret trying his communism zoie star consumer fantasy short town he united about by bond john in to actor mixed stephanie discovers holiday past bitter a pitsiladis on wa dark julian quest himself completed family originally lonely state executive is ramsay 2014 when that ken employee canadian establish written toy go quasimusical released yuri review acting project childrens patch gabe received hidden factory of sovietstyle hall craig much soviet palmer jon christopher for praised 1980s and run inspired real suresh goodwill fictional satirically take cast grim culture named 2015 film directed jessie the story producing officer richings comedy but	2014 Canadian dark fantasy comedy film	canadian 2014 fantasy dark comedy film	Building

Alte Brücke (Frankfurt)	"<p><b>Alte Brücke</b> (German: ""old bridge"") is a bridge in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. It is the oldest bridge over the lower course of the river Main, and until 1886 was the only stone bridge crossing the river. From the Middle Ages until the year 1914, it connected the ""Fahrgasse"" in Frankfurt Altstadt with the ""Brückenstraße"" in Sachsenhausen. Since its first mention in official documents in 1222, the development of Frankfurt has been strongly influenced by the bridge. Over the centuries, Alte Brücke has been destroyed and reconstructed at least 18 times. With its 13 brick-built circular arches, the <i>Sachsenhausen Bridge</i> was one of the most prominent buildings of the city, but failing to meet the increasing demands of the modern road and ship traffic, it was demolished in 1914. </p><p>The current Alte Brücke, sometimes called ""Neue Alte Brücke"" (German: ""new old bridge""), was inaugurated on 15 August 1926 by then-Lord-Mayor Ludwig Landmann. Two of its originally eight red sandstone-lined vaults were blown up by German soldiers on 26 March 1945. After an initial provisional reconstruction, the middle part of the bridge was replaced by a steel through truss bridge and placed in operation again on 15 September 1965. </p><p>In 2006, the Alte Brücke received a new porticus, which resembles a watermill that had historically been present at the bridge. Today, the view of the bridge is characterized by four portal walls at both sides of the bridge's middle part. These have been built in the course of a complete renovation in 2014.

Fleisch Bridge	"<p>The <b>Fleisch Bridge</b> (German: <i lang=""de"">Fleischbrücke</i> or ""Meat Bridge"") or <b>Pegnitz Bridge</b> (<i>Pegnitzbrücke</i>) is a late Renaissance bridge in Nuremberg, Germany. The bridge crosses the river Pegnitz in the center of the old town, linking the districts St. Sebald and St. Lorenz along the axis of the main market. The single-arch bridge was built between 1596 and 1598 and replaced an earlier mixed construction of stone and wood which had been repeatedly destroyed by flood. </p><p>The Fleisch Bridge is notable for several technical features that were advanced for its time. These include an unusual large width of 15.3 m, and a clear span of 27 m which made it the largest masonry bridge arch in Germany at the time of its construction. With a rise of only 4.2 m, the arch features a span-to-rise ratio of 6.4 to 1, giving the bridge an almost unprecedented flat profile.</p><p>This, however, came at the cost of high lateral thrusts even for a segmental arch bridge. This problem was solved by a particularly innovative construction of the abutments which were built onto 2000 wooden piles, 400 of which were rammed obliquely into the grounds. A very similar arrangement of the abutments had also been implemented slightly earlier at the Rialto bridge, leading to speculations about a technology transfer from Venice, with which Nuremberg shared close trade links. A recent in-depth research, however, stresses the originality of the Fleisch Bridge on grounds of technical differences between the two bridges.</p><p>The Fleisch Bridge has practically remained unchanged since the addition of a portal in 1599 and survived World War II almost unscathed. A Latin inscription at the portal reads: <i>Omnia habent ortus suaque in crementa sed ecce quem cernis nunquam bos fuit hic Vitulus.</i> (""All things have a beginning and grow, but the ox upon whom you now look was never a calf."") </p>"	crementa never profilethis war sed this or even 1596 market stone ortus onto abutment whom sebald an quem 1598 singlearch district town very bridgesthe survived fleischbrücke only rialto slightly rise came particularly about by unusual 1 st in technology earlier to all mixed bridge however advanced fleisch large have transfer trade these read construction almost unprecedented bos a time you which on look wa close originality cernis upon innovative ground shared span two vitulus leading wooden old pegnitzbrücke include meat 2000 late ox pegnitz is that calf lorenz spantorise m been suaque cross with linking main repeatedly german center addition but were since germany flood it speculation unchanged nuremberg rammed 42 difference notable of link 400 stress beginning destroyed width pile renaissance obliquely into had recent omnia segmental for nunquam solved largest and ecce cost indepth from technical fuit unscathed ii between lateral inscription grow latin habent several built now masonry ha giving river wood portal hic world made venice research thrust also clear practically remained flat axis 153 64 thing similar the 27 problem replaced along arch ratio implemented feature high arrangement at 1599	late Renaissance bridge in Nuremberg, Germany	nuremberg renaissance germany in late bridge	Building

Stühlinger Bridge	<p>The <b>Stühlinger bridge</b> was made of prestressed concrete for tramways, pedestrians and cyclists in Freiburg im Breisgau. It connects the Bertoldstraße with the Wannerstraße. In doing so, it crosses the Bismarckallee, the central bus station, the main railway station Hauptbahnhof, the Wetzingerstraße and the Stühlinger Church Square. The right short individual sections make it seem like an inner-city viaduct or an elevated highway in proportion to the whole length. </p><p>The Sühlinger bridge fulfills simultaneously three functions: it connects the Old City district with the Stühlinger district, it is used as a tramway station and as a pedestrian bridge overcrossing the main railway station and gives access to the railway platforms. </p><p>Since 2009, the bridge needs rehabilitation because water infiltrates the concrete. As soon as the rehabilitation is carried out, the cyclists are not allowed to use the bridge anymore and have to use the neighboring Wiwilí Bridge as an alternative one. The reason for this is the height of the guardrails of the bridge, which only rise up to 1,00 meter instead of the latterly legal required 1,20 meters. With the start of the rehabilitation, the hitherto grandfather clause runs out and the regulation is obligatory. The rehabilitation initially planned for 2012 was deferred until August 2012 because of delays and call for bids. Since they were still at the call for bids in the year 2013, it was not possible to make a statement about when it would be rehabilitated in November 2013. Now the rehabilitation is supposed to start in the spring 2019.</p><p>In the autumn 2013 the spiral stairs leading to the Freiburg Konzerthaus were underpinned with wood. Because of budget shortage of the civil engineering department of Freiburg in November 2013, it was decided to call for bids in autumn 2015 and that the rehabilitation of the stairs will start in the spring 2016. In the spring of 2016 they thought that the reparations could start at the earliest in the autumn 2017.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1398 Cached time: 20220514222449 Cache expiry: 86400 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.213 seconds Real time usage: 0.284 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 482/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 19013/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 1734/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 13/100 Expensive parser function count: 2/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 7643/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.121/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3568428/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 266.151 1 -total 38.18% 101.617 4 Template:Cite_web 25.31% 67.364 1 Template:Short_description 17.25% 45.913 1 Template:Orphan 16.49% 43.875 2 Template:Ambox 14.83% 39.479 1 Template:Draft_other 12.03% 32.008 1 Template:Pagetype 5.99% 15.931 2 Template:Main_other 5.06% 13.455 1 Template:SDcat 4.52% 12.038 1 Template:Cleanup_reorganize -->	supposed this or used individual 2013 spiral spring length budget like an deferred short viaduct district simultaneously shortage 2017 seem only delay still 2016 alternative rise about railway innercity carried in section to be bus bridge they need guardrail have concrete instead allowed konzerthaus a hitherto one which 120 bid wa up because wetzingerstraße decided tramway 2009 sühlinger leading whole old call pedestrian use obligatory engineering is when reparation that legal civil could start required autumn im wiwilí meter cross with give elevated freiburg main statement were since it not right until platform fulfills of square thought rehabilitation will neighboring grandfather clause function 100 breisgau 2019in proportion doing for make highway hauptbahnhof and underpinned department stühlinger run august regulation would anymore november reason so station now cyclist overcrossing access soon wood stair out latterly possible made central earliest connects bismarckallee city are prestressed water rehabilitated infiltrates three 2015 initially the height year bertoldstraße church wannerstraße at planned 2012	bridge over railway tracks at Central Station, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany	freiburg breisgau track station central railway germany im over at bridge	Building

Astrodome (aeronautics)	<p>An <b>astrodome</b> is a hemispherical transparent dome that was installed in the cabin roof of an aircraft. Such a dome would allow a trained navigator to perform astronavigation and thereby guide the aircraft at night without the aid of land-based visual references.</p><p>Astronavigation was a principal early method for attaining an aircraft's position during nighttime by referencing the stars. The practice of sighting stars using a sextant had been commonplace amongst navigators for hundreds of years aboard ships, and proved to be applicable to faster moving aircraft as well, however, the task required a 360-degree view of the horizon. By installing an astrodome, such a view could be readily achieved. The Royal Air Force (RAF) adopted astronavigation techniques into standard navigator training during the late 1930s, both the methodologies used and the design of the sextant were adapted to better suit the aviation environment, while many aircraft ordered by the service would be furnished with astrodomes to enable navigators to use this technique. </p><p>During the Second World War, astronavigation became a critical ability used to by various nations to conduct long distance flights at night, particularly strategic bombing campaigns. The RAF's choice to mainly operate its bombers at night meant that its crews were particularly dependent on astronavigation for finding their way to and from targets. The introduction of electronic means of navigation soon competed with astronavigation, although electronic techniques had their shortcomings as well.</p>	perform war strategic choice night moving methodology suit landbased referencing practice used this competed star an target shortcoming astronavigation installing ordered adapted particularly 360degree 1930s readily by in while to be ship however introduction various a better environment on view mean wa air proved distance ability sighting both nation operate late use without is trained that such royal training could required been many horizon with service critical achieved adopted were it became cabin furnished during aviation principal applicable aid of flight campaign finding enable dome hemispherical way long transparent their allow into nighttime had amongst faster method electronic for roof raf early and from force visual hundred bomber would dependent thereby design guide navigator second sextant technique soon astrodome world crew referencesastronavigation commonplace aboard attaining aircraft although conduct using mainly task position navigation the standard year meant well at bombing installed	window dome for astronomical navigation on airplanes	for on airplane astronomical navigation dome window	Building
Bubble canopy	<p>A <b>bubble canopy</b> is an aircraft canopy constructed without bracing, for the purpose of providing a wider unobstructed field of view to the pilot, often providing 360° all-round visibility. </p><p>The designs of bubble canopies can drastically vary; some, such as on later versions of the F4U Corsair, are built into the upper rear fuselage, while others, like the canopy of the P-51D Mustang and most modern combat aircraft, are built flush with the fuselage, providing unobstructed rear visibility. Although experimented with as early as the First World War, the bubble canopy was introduced to widespread use during the Second World War, being used upon a number of American, British, and Japanese aircraft, commonly fighters. </p><p>During the postwar era, the bubble canopy became a common feature of jet-powered fighter aircraft. Outside of combat aircraft, such canopies have also been adopted upon several helicopters and general aviation aircraft, often for roles that benefit from a high level of exterior visibility, such as aerial reconnaissance. </p>	war often used pilot first like an 360° p51d common field to while general role vary have american aerial introduced a mustang on view most wa upon helicopter experimented constructed providing japanese visibility use wider unobstructed later being without fighter is benefit that such version outside rear been commonly with flush adopted can number became purpose during aviation combat some f4u of bracing fuselage into drastically upper widespread for corsair early and reconnaissance others from modern design second several postwar built jetpowered world canopy bubble allround also aircraft although are era british exterior level the feature high	type of aircraft canopy	aircraft canopy type of	Building
American Foursquare	"<p>The <b>American Foursquare</b> or <b>American Four Square</b> is an American house style popular from the mid-1890s to the late 1930s. A reaction to the ornate and mass-produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century, the American Foursquare was plain, often incorporating handcrafted ""honest"" woodwork (unless purchased from a mail-order catalog). This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles. It is also sometimes called Transitional Period. </p><p>The hallmarks of the style include a basically square, boxy design, two-and-one-half stories high, usually with four large, boxy rooms to a floor (with the exception of the attic floor, which typically has only one or two rooms), a center dormer, and a large front porch with wide stairs. The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space, to use a small city lot to best advantage. Other common features included a hipped roof, arched entries between common rooms, built-in cabinetry, and Craftsman-style woodwork. </p><p>A typical design would be as follows: first floor, from front to back, on one side, the living room and dining room; while on the other side, the entry room or foyer, stairway and kitchen. Sometimes a bathroom was also included. Second floor, front to back, on one side, bedroom, bathroom and bedroom; while on the other side, bedroom, stairway and bedroom. The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side-by-side closets between the bedrooms. This gave a very efficient layout, with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway. The top floor was generally just a big open space with one to four dormers, essentially an attic, whether finished into living space or not. The basement generally contained a large natural convection furnace or boiler. </p>"	house craftsman room natural this or often essentially hallmark first generally an throughout four typically very only furnace slightly bedroom just 1930s entry exception in common foyer while to builtin be foursquare space boxy attic longer large american massproduced ornate cabinetry a one which on sometimes wa arched two century provides honest victorian included include dormer late use usually corner prairie basement hipped sidebyside layout is kitchen each wide handcrafted dimension with stairway unless transitional it not dining revival lot porch living incorporates square of school bathroom other floor open side basically closet into woodwork had reaction contained maximum boiler style amount popular advantage roof and from plain between would whether follows front design second element last craftsmanstyle half ha gave shape best back stair mailorder period typical top incorporating also purchased twoandonehalf small city efficient mid1890s catalog 19th the story along called interior centralized convection high feature center finished big	Housing style	style housing	Building

John Pearce House	<p>The <b>John Pearce House</b> is a historic house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is notable for its architecture and as the only extant house on the Downtown section of Central Avenue, which is otherwise occupied entirely by commercial buildings. The house was built in 1905 by Dr. John F. Pearce (c. 1859–1937), one of the city's first physicians. The contractor, Wallace Hesselden, also built the Henry Mann House the same year. After Pearce moved out of the house in 1933, it was used for various functions including a boarding house and chiropractic clinic. In 1982, the house was renovated and converted to office space. The architect for the renovation was Antoine Predock. The property was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Cracked Ice screen	"<p>The <b><i>Cracked Ice</i> screen</b> is a late 18th-century low two-fold Japanese screen (<i>byōbu</i>) intended for use at the Japanese tea ceremony.

It would be used as a <i>furosaki byōbu</i> (風炉先屏風, literally ""furnace folding screen"") placed near the hearth of a room used for the Japanese tea ceremony, shielding the fire from draughts and also forming a decorative backdrop behind the tea utensils (茶道具, <i>chadōgu</i>).

It is signed and sealed ""應擧"" (Ōkyo). The minimal composition is typical of that portion of the Edo period and is an early example of the influence of Western painting on Japanese art.

The monumental two-sided <i>byōbu</i> screens became a symbol of the Rinpa tradition, but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage. In the backside of Kōrin's painting of Raijin, Hōitsu painted what has been described as ""summer plants revived by a sudden shower and the swollen flow of a river"", and on the backside of Kōrin's Fūjin, ""autumn plants swaying and the red leaves of ivy blown in a strong wind"".</p><p>The work is dated from the early 19th century, probably circa 1821, and the attribution to Hōitsu has not been disputed. Both screens include the signature-seal ""by Hōitsu"" and a round seal with red letters ""Bunsen"", another name used by Hōitsu.</p><p>Hōitsu's style, which ""aimed for the natural integration of poetic emotion and decorative technique"", has been linked to ""the elegant and refined taste common to poetry, which is another field of art he practiced"". His use of <i>tarashikomi</i> ""to paint plants and flowers with poetic feelings"" has been highly praised. This technique, in which a second layer of paint is applied before the first layer is dry, was perfected by Sōtatsu and used often by later Rinpa artists. </p><p>The screens are now part of the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally.

More recently, they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades; in this use, the shell is known as <b>capiz shell</b> (<i>kapis</i>). Capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue, chalk and varnish. </p><p>Distribution extends from the shallows of the Gulf of Aden to around the Philippines, where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. The mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores, in bays, coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft). </p><p>Populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling, dredging, blast fishing and surface-supplied diving. In the Philippines, fisheries are now regulated through permits, quotas, size limits and protected habitats. In spite of this, resources continue to be depleted.</p><p>The nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm (5.9 in) in diameter, reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm (2.8 to 3.9 in). The shell is secured by a V-shaped ligament. Males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads. Fertilization is external and larvae are free-swimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis, eventually settling on the bottom.

Studies in 1993, however, have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex. The species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species. </p><p>Bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle, giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish. They are small to medium-sized squids, averaging 3.8 to 33 centimetres (1.5 to 13.0 in) in length. They exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in May, but it can vary by location. The paralarvae resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching. Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate, reaching 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months. They are a short-lived species, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days. </p><p>The diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish. They are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished extensively for human consumption in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture.

Statue of Ramesses II	<p>The <b>Statue of Ramesses II</b> is a 3,200-year-old figure of Ramesses II, depicting him standing. It was discovered in 1820 by Giovanni Battista Caviglia at the Great Temple of Ptah near Memphis, Egypt. It is made from red granite and weighs 83 tons. </p><p>The statue was found broken in six pieces and earlier attempts at restoration failed. In 1955, Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser moved it to the large Bab Al-Hadid Square in Cairo, outside Cairo's main railway station; the square was then renamed Ramses Square. There the statue was restored to its full height of 11 meters and erected on a three-metre pedestal at the edge of a fountain. It was stabilized by iron bars inside the body.</p><p>Over time Ramses Square turned out to be an unsuitable location, as the statue was exposed to corrosive pollution and constant vibration from traffic and subways. The Egyptian government decided to relocate it to a more appropriate location in 2006. At a temporary site on the Giza Plateau it underwent restoration before being moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) in Giza in 2018.</p><p>The transportation of the statue from Ramses Square to Giza was a technological challenge that had been in the planning since 2002. A replica had been made and was transported several weeks before the scheduled actual move along the planned route to Giza to test the proposed relocation process. The move took place on August 25, 2006. During its ten-hour transport the statue was wrapped and covered in rubber foam. Two flat-back trucks carried the weight of the statue and its support structures as it travelled in a vertical position.</p><p>The move has been criticized for its costs and the concern about pollution in the Giza location.</p>	found unsuitable weighs him plateau granite an pollution traffic grand subway week route renamed bodyover vertical about by railway carried in near gem earlier discovered to be weight wrapped scheduled inside exposed minister large edge museum iron before a pedestal time on piece wa 25 transport decided flatback two nasser prime relocation egyptian cairo six test criticized government transportation temporary alhadid structure being is attempt restored planning great red giza that fountain outside been meter there site 1955 main travelled standing since 83 restoration threemetre it replica full during ramesses 1820 process positionthe of caviglia square covered appropriate failed vibration gamal technological ptah ramses 11 truck had depicting battista location for 2006 took corrosive and temple ton challenge cost from august ii moved underwent 3200yearold place tenhour rubber 2002 several station broken actual ha 2018the out relocate transported made memphis erected statue then support turned bab abdel stabilized more move the constant concern giovanni height along figure foam proposed egypt bar at planned	ancient Egyptian statue	ancient egyptian statue	Building

Nowadays, the Stone also serves as a focus for commemorative events and for gatherings related to current human rights issues. </p><p>The monument consists of a large boulder brought from the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea, where the Solovki prison camp opened in 1923. The camp was the malignant cell which, in Solzhenitsyn's metaphor, metastazised to create the entire Gulag network of forced labour camps. The Stone is a fitting symbol of the Gulag and the related practices of political terror. The Memorial society in Petersburg was behind the creation of the monument.

Havmannen	"<p><i><b>Havmannen</b></i>, or <i><b>Havmann</b></i> (in English: ""The Man from the Sea"") is a granite stone sculpture by the English artist Antony Gormley located in the city of Mo i Rana in northern Norway. The sculpture stands proud in the ""Ranfjord"" in the city of Mo i Rana, which is often referred to in Norway as ""Polarsirkelbyen"" (in English: the ""Arctic Circle City""). The sculpture is 11 metres (36 ft) tall, weighs 60 tonnes (59 long tons; 66 short tons), and according to Lonely Planet is ""forever up to his knees in water, turns his back on the town and gazes resolutely out over the fjord"".</p><p>The artist originally envisaged the sculpture being created in steel, based on the traditional steel industry which was one of the pillars of industrial Mo i Rana, and placed in the fjord to illustrate the sharp contrasts between nature and industry. However, the local industry was undergoing major changes at the time, with what was effectively state subsidized and unprofitable factories being closed down, including the local steel works. Realizing the project using local steel therefore became impossible. As a result, Havmann was to become Antony Gormley's first large stone sculpture.) </p><p>The sculpture was created and erected in the Ranfjord in 1995 as part of Artscape Nordland, causing controversy and much debate in the local media, notably in the local paper Rana Blad, which received hundreds of letters and over 300 poems dedicated to the sculpture. The local debate was ongoing for months, and mainly focused on two issues: whether the commissioning of the sculpture was good use of public money, and maybe less serious, a concern about the newly erected sculpture's lack of an erectable device. Despite the initial debate and controversy, citizens of Mo i Rana today take pride in the sculpture by the internationally renowned artist Antony Gormley and have adopted it as an ambassador for the town. The sculpture has inspired and given name to an annual festival, Havmanndagene (the ""Havmann days"") which is held in the city every year in May. </p>"	weighs dedicated havmannen 36 his over or often illustrate annual stone granite initial first an sea 60 short town renowned le ongoing arctic about by in money to may tall however havmann subsidized large have ft located 59 held rana down a time device one which artist on undergoing wa major public lack festival mo up two change unprofitable blad originally lonely impossible paper fjordthe today state use being effectively is havmanndagene internationally ranfjord resolutely nordland according english envisaged what industrial name with given issue knee therefore steel gormley project adopted part pillar month it work became received antony commissioning result medium factory controversy of citizen local proud nature debate much artscape norway referred metre long 300 realizing causing circle 11 including erectable industry closed despite newly for based tonne and gormleys ton planet from good hundred between whether inspired man day 1995 fjord ha 66 back polarsirkelbyen turn out ambassador forever take pride traditional placed erected letter every city poem using sculpture water mainly contrast the become concern serious year sharp stand focused maybe gaze northern i notably at created	sculpture by Antony Gormley	gormley antony sculpture by	Building

Shi Family Grand Courtyard	<p><b>Shi Family Grand Courtyard</b> (Tiānjīn Shí Jiā Dà Yuàn, 天津石家大院) is situated in Yangliuqing, Xiqing District, which is the former residence of wealthy merchant Shi Yuanshi – the 4th son of Shi Wancheng, one of the eight great masters in Tianjin. First built in 1875, it covers over 6,000 square meters, including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses, a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family. Shifu Garden, which finished its expansion in October 2003, covers 1,200 square meters, incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and delicacy of south garden. Now the courtyard of Shi family covers about 10,000 square meters, which is called the first mansion in North China. Now it serves as the folk custom museum in Yangliuqing, which has a large collection of folk art pieces like Yanliuqing New Year pictures, brick sculpture. </p><p>Shi's ancestor came from Dong'e County in Shandong, engaged in water transport of grain. As the wealth gradually accumulated, the Shi Family moved to Yangliuqing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence. Shi Yuanshi came from the fourth generation of the family, who was a successful businessman and a good household manager, and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale. It is believed to be the first mansion in the west of Tianjin. </p><p>The residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passageway in the middle, on which there are four archways. On the east side of the courtyard, there are traditional single-story houses with rows of rooms around the four sides, which was once the living area for the Shi Family. The rooms on north side were the accountants' office. On the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worshiping Buddha, theater and the south reception room. On both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants. </p><p>Today, the Shi mansion, located in the township of Yangliuqing to the west of central Tianjin, stands as a surprisingly well-preserved monument to China's pre-revolution mercantile spirit. It also serves as an on-location shoot for many of China's popular historical dramas. Many of the rooms feature period furniture, paintings and calligraphy, and the extensive Shifu Garden. </p><p>Part of the complex has been turned into the Yangliuqing Museum, which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyards' construction, local folk art and customs, and traditional period furnishings and crafts. </p>	house surprisingly room october 275 over this row tiānjīn wealthy 4th east around north first served like businessman an four district display master grand courtyard 2003 came about maid by in reception to be symmetric household former extensive large museum worship shandong drama servant acquired construction buddha located monument a custom time one which on major piece wa gradually complex bought aspect generation transport up 1875 successful family collection formed both wellpreserved brick new grain today donge fourth calligraphy craft mansion 6000 serf includes is imperial office archway set shifu 天津石家大院 great situated that eight yard tianjin worshiping been manager many residence furnishing 200 china meter dà garden with accumulated there son were part engaged jiā south ancestor it township theater wancheng until thus passageway furniture yangliuqing living incorporates of square local hall xiqing spirit merchant – singlestory side expansion their yuàn into including business tract mercantile cover onlocation for based 10000 popular and shoot wealth believed from good delicacy moved land shí place several once built now art ha painting 1200 enlarged period traditional central symbolic yanliuqing also county small shis axis are apartment picture turned west sculpture water powerful present area prerevolution the year middle elegance called stand accountant historical focused yuanshi folk feature scale who shi finished	building in Wang Jingwei regime, China	wang building in china jingwei regime	Building

The modern Arabic name refers to the prophet Yusuf, the Quranic counterpart of the Biblical Joseph.</p><p>In prehistoric times, the canal was a natural offshoot of the Nile which created a lake to the west during high floods. Beginning with the 12th dynasty, the waterway was enlarged and the Fayyum was developed to enlarge Lake Moeris. The canal was built into the natural incline of the valley, creating a channel 15 km long and 5 m deep that sloped into the Fayyum depression. The canal was controlled by the Ha-Uar Dam, which was actually two dams that regulated the flow into the lake and out of the Nile. As the surrounding area changed at about 230 BC, the Bahr Yussef eventually became neglected, leaving most of Lake Moeris to dry up creating the depression that exists today and the modern province of Al Fayyum. </p><p>During the medieval period, the canal was still a major communication axis to connect Fayyum to Cairo.</p><p>The Bahr Yussef still exists today, feeding water northwards into the Birket Qarun, parallel with the Nile. </p>"	biblical channel natural or leaving offshoot changed after still josephin refers at connect about prehistoric by in controlled to arab regulated known joseph a time major which most wa lake المنهى ending up two conquest cairothe fayyum egyptian today use بحر flow sloped km is northward great bahr 12th that canal exists m 230 eventually διῶρυξ derived name neglected al province parallel with τωμις feeding it flood became medieval tmt during yussef of moeris developed beginning long 15 tomis counterpart into creating actually surrounding dynasty quranic and from modern dry built qarun nile almanhi river μεγάλη enlarged out yusuf 5 period communication also connects ancient bc hauar axis arabic west depression water greek dam area waterway deep valley incline the يوسف enlarge called birket prophet high egypt translated created	geographical object	geographical object	City

Paisius of Hilendar	"<p><b>Saint Paisius of Hilendar</b> or <b>Paìsiy Hilendàrski</b> (Bulgarian: <span lang=""bg"">Свети Паисий Хилендарски</span>) (1722–1773) was a Bulgarian clergyman and a key Bulgarian National Revival figure. He is most famous for being the author of <i>Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya</i>, the second modern Bulgarian history after the work of Petar Bogdan Bakshev from 1667, ""History of Bulgaria"". Most Bulgarians are taught that he was the forefather of the Bulgarian National Revival.</p><p>Paisius was born in the Samokov eparchy of the time. There is a scientific dispute about the exact place of his birth, although the prevailing consensus points the town of Bansko. He established himself in the Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos in 1745, where he was later a hieromonk and deputy-abbot. Collecting materials for two years through hard work and even visiting the Habsburg monarchy, he finished his <i>Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya</i> in 1762 in the Zograf Monastery. The book was the first attempt to write a complete history of Bulgaria and attempted to awake and strengthen Bulgarian national consciousnesses.</p><p> The most famous part of the whole book is the paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>""Oh, you unwise moron! Why are you ashamed to call yourself a Bulgarian and why don't you read and speak in your native language? Weren't Bulgarians powerful and glorious once? Didn't they take taxes from strong Romans and wise Greeks? Out of all the Slavic nations they were the bravest one. Our rulers were the first ones to call themselves kings, the first ones to have patriarchs, the first ones to baptise their people.(...) Why are you ashamed of your great history and your great language and why do you leave it to turn yourselves into Greeks? Why do you think they are any better than you? Well, here you're right because did you see a Greek leave his country and ancestry like you do?""</p></blockquote> <p>This more or less signifies the purpose of the author who speaks about the danger of Bulgarians falling victim to the Hellenization policies of the mainly Greek clergy. These anti-Greek sentiments presented in Paisius writing, characterized the Greeks as some kind of Bulgarian national enemies. The book's first manual copy was done by Sophronius of Vratsa in 1765. Structurally, Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya consists of two introductions, several chapters that discuss various historic events, a chapter about the ""Slavic teachers"", the disciples of Cyril and Methodius, a chapter about the Bulgarian saints, and an epilogue. As Paisius toured Bulgaria as a mendicant friar, he brought his work, which was copied and spread among the Bulgarians. He is thought to have died on the way to Mount Athos near Ampelino (modern-day Asenovgrad). </p>"	speak ruler paisius policy his visiting or even this did monarchy unwise died historic first like an town after slavic sophronius spread le he think native about taught speaks by didnt in near to all modernday habsburg they here key material паисий consensus monastery petar leave have dispute characterized read these introduction strengthen a time you bogdan on saint one most wa baptise better which 1762 enemy because himself two copied consists 1722–1773 where whole king call famous glorious nation awake ashamed epilogue toured history roman later manual various being scientific bravest is structurally done hilendar attempt that great 1765 vratsa prevailing among cyril themselves yourselves there хилендарски copy established samokov part were writing signifies istoriya our hilendàrski birth werent bulgarian work it revival right purpose danger your hellenization eparchy sentiment falling some bulgaria disciple of slavyanobolgarskaya bansko 1667 methodius thought zograf hard complete see way point collecting mendicant their moron into strong book author deputyabbot presented paìsiy consciousness forefather kind friar write for antigreek youre and people 1745 from any yourself clergyman through do modern place second hieromonk once several tax brought ampelino language national chapter out turn born take teacher mount asenovgrad patriarch ancestry attempted although hilandar are mainly revivalpaisius exact athos powerful wise victim more greek свети clergy discus than event the country bakshev why year figure paragraphoh well who dont finished	Bulgarian clergyman	clergyman bulgarian	City

His ringing and expressive coloratura dexterity in the highest register of his voice, the <i>tenorino</i>, inspired the writing of operatic roles which today are almost impossible to cast. As a singer Rubini was the major early exponent of the Romantic style of the <i>bel canto</i> era of Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti. </p><p>Rubini is remembered as an extraordinary bel canto singer, one of the most famous in Europe in the 1820s to 1840s. He also popularized the use of a pervasive vibrato as a means of heightening the emotional impact of his operatic performances. However, if his upper register was exceptional—he could effortlessly go up to a ""ringing"" high F (F5) (a note that most tenors today escape because of their ""chesty"" technique), he was reported as barely audible in the others parts of his voice and his tone was ""slightly veiled"". He also had a limited volume control, struggling to produce mezzo-forte or mezzo-piano dynamics. On the other hand, he was admired for the ""infectious"" joy he took to sing, his great agility and refined musicianship.</p>"	his or agility caruso tenor an extraordinary he ringing slightly reported 1794 tenorino in exponent refined 7 to hand however role mezzoforte operatic singer struggling march remembered almost a time coloratura major which one mean most wa on up because dexterity 1840s escape exceptional—he heightening f5 audible famous impossible today use volume later is that f great could vincenzo limited note 1854 go rubini impact joy performance part writing musicianship veiled register effortlessly voice admired italian of – emotional other their control had 1820s battista upper chesty for style enrico early took and pervasive if others gaetano barely inspired day highest bellini donizetti technique europe 3 also produce expressive cast are era april romantic dynamic infectious vibrato tone the giovanni mezzopiano sing bel popularized canto high	Italian opera singer (1794-1854)	italian opera singer 17941854	City

He is best known for having planned and led the 1519 Spanish expedition to the East Indies across the Pacific Ocean to open a maritime trade route, during which he discovered the interoceanic passage bearing thereafter his name and achieved the first European navigation from the Atlantic to Asia. During this voyage, Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in 1521 in the present-day Philippines. After that, Juan Sebastián Elcano took the lead of the expedition, and with its few other surviving members, in one of the two remaining ships, completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth when they returned to Spain in 1522.</p><p>Born 4 February 1480 into a family of minor Portuguese nobility, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer in service of the Portuguese Crown in Asia. King Manuel I of Portugal refused to support Magellan's plan to reach the Maluku Islands (the ""Spice Islands"") by sailing westwards around the American continent. Facing some criminal offences, Magellan left Portugal and proposed the same expedition to King Charles I of Spain, who accepted it. Consequently, many in Portugal considered him a traitor and he never returned. In Seville, he married, fathered two children, and organised the expedition. For his allegiance to the Hispanic Monarchy, in 1518, Magellan was appointed admiral of the Spanish Fleet and given command of the expedition – the five-ship Armada of Molucca. He was also made Commander of the Order of Santiago, one of the highest military ranks of the Spanish Empire.</p><p>Granted special powers and privileges by the King, he led the Armada from Sanlucar de Barrameda, southwest across the Atlantic Ocean, to the eastern coast of South America, and down to Patagonia. Despite a series of storms and mutinies, the expedition successfully passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Mar del Sur, which Magellan renamed the ""Peaceful Sea"" (the modern Pacific Ocean). The expedition reached Guam and, shortly after, the Philippine islands. There Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521. Under the command of captain Juan Sebastian Elcano, the expedition later reached the Spice Islands. To navigate back to Spain and avoid seizure by the Portuguese, the expedition's two remaining ships split, one attempting, unsuccessfully, to reach New Spain by sailing eastwards across the Pacific, while the other, commanded by Elcano, sailed westwards via the Indian Ocean and up the Atlantic coast of Africa, finally arriving at the expedition's port of departure and thereby completing the first complete circuit of the globe. </p><p>While in the Kingdom of Portugal's service, Magellan had already reached the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia on previous voyages traveling east (from 1505 to 1511–1512). By visiting this area again but now traveling west, Magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.</p>"	never bearing presentday seville his this or visiting atlantic monarchy minor him married pacific east around attempting port 4 first sea remaining returned killed after indie he route traitor at left renamed by fathered southwest strait in rank magalhães led to discovered while they charles ship mutiny unsuccessfully personal power commanded mɐɣɐˈʎɐ̃jʃ known 1505 considered across trade american ðe having southeast down a time circumnavigation one which on wa privilege up voyage peaceful few dɨ two sailed completed family arriving king series manuel consequently new allegiance history magellan same later reach is when spanish order avoid that storm successfully admiral again many sailor appointed name magallanes portugal captain interoceanic with skilled spice given mactan there child service kingdom fiveship command philippine achieved but hispanic fɨɾˈnɐ̃w south barrameda it earth became finally already during fleet eastern some of offence island expedition africa eastward special – criminal plan via complete previous open sebastián ferdinand other westward traveling crown subject into navigate had maluku military despite mar split continent for commander patagonia took asia and del under from facing 1519 through passed indian 1521 naval portuguese modern elcano completing archipelago thereby organised highest now nearly santiago nobility maritime european sailing best member feɾˈnando fernando guam spain accepted back globe 1480 explorer america maɣaˈʎanes made circuit february 1511–1512 reached ipa also seizure 1518 support refused 1522born lead sanlucar april shortly west sur area navigation surviving fernão 27 the thereafter empiregranted departure molucca officer proposed armada sebastian i de ocean juan battle who passage planned malay coast	Portuguese explorer in the service of Spain	service portuguese explorer of in spain the	City

This means that according to official statistics, the land area covered by urban areas is three times larger in Finland than in Norway though the total urban population is roughly the same (ssb.no). It also means that while the population of Danish “byområder” is usually less than half of the population of the “functional urban area” defined by Eurostat, the population of a Finnish “tätort” is usually around 80% of the respective “functional urban area” defined by Eurostat. In 2013, the “functional urban area” of Aarhus thus had a population of 845,971 while the “functional urban area” of Tampere had a population of 364,992.

List of Spider-Man enemies	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Spider-Man is a superhero created by Marvel Comics who debuted in the anthology comic book series issue <i>Amazing Fantasy</i> #15 (August 1962) during the Silver Age of Comics and is Marvel's most popular superhero. After his debut, he got his own comic book entitled <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>. This comic introduced many of what would become his major supervillain adversaries. Spider-Man then became popular enough for more Spider-Man comic spinoffs (<i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i>, <i>Marvel Team-Up</i>, <i>Web of Spider-Man</i>, <i>Peter Parker: Spider-Man</i> etc.) which introduced more recurring enemies of the web-slinger, across their various incarnations. </p><p>As with Spider-Man, most of his villains' powers originate from scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology. They can be classified into multiple categories, such as animal-themed villains (Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Lizard, Rhino, Scorpion, Jackal, Beetle, Kangaroo, Tarantula, and Puma), those with powers over the elements (Sandman, Electro, Molten Man, and Hydro-Man), horror-themed villains (the Green Goblin, the Hobgoblin, Morbius, Morlun, and the Symbiotes), crime lords (the Kingpin, Tombstone, Hammerhead, Silvermane, and Mister Negative), inventors (the Shocker, the Tinkerer, Spencer Smythe, and Alistair Smythe), and masters of trickery and illusion (the Chameleon and Mysterio). There are, however, numerous villains that don't fit into any specific category, such as Kraven the Hunter and Mephisto, the latter of whom originated as a Silver Surfer villain. The villains oftentimes form teams such as the Sinister Six to oppose the web-slinger. </p><p>Spider-Man is notable for having numerous villains that redeemed themselves and became antiheroes, such as Black Cat, the Prowler, Morbius, Kraven, and Silver Sable. Also, unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man doesn't have one particular archenemy, but rather three: the Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and the Eddie Brock version of Venom, the latter two of whom have been similarly redeemed and depicted as antiheroes. </p><p>The rogues gallery of Spider-Man has garnered positive critical acclaim and has been considered one of the greatest rogues galleries of all time. </p> "	silvermane shocker tombstone his this or over sable depicted vulture animalthemed morlun alistair whom villain fantasy fit acclaim surfer after master he similarly web originate silver rogue by inventor in positive technology illusion be form oftentimes to antihero they osborn all however puma power garnered have considered across smythe mephisto having sinister introduced accident various a spiderman any major which one time most entitled enemy numerous team two peter debuted webslinger oppose six series kangaroo etc mister octopus crime scorpion scientific doctor is greatest classified molten green hunter that brock electro supervillain such version spinoffs been many spectacular dont what specific kingpin themselves superheroes with issue there lizard tarantula critical hobgoblin but can negative anthology became symbiotes gallery got during sandman adversary notable of own morbius chameleon venom teamup lord kraven originated mysterio category 15 misuse their into comic book amazing particular recurring tinkerer eddie for popular horrorthemed and those multiple 1962 august from hydroman incarnation archenemy norman would man trickery rhino element enough black ha marvel debut jackal prowler goblin cat superhero also then age are parker hammerhead latter more three rather unlike the become doesnt beetle redeemed who spencer created	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Comics_characters

Wonder Woman	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Wonder Woman</b> is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in <i>All Star Comics</i> #8 published October 21, 1941 with her first feature in <i>Sensation Comics</i> #1 in January 1942. The <i>Wonder Woman</i> title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously ever since. In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is <b>Princess Diana of Themyscira</b>. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince.</p><p>Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's appearance.</p><p>Wonder Woman's origin story (from Golden to Bronze Age) relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In 2011, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The character has changed in depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology. </p><p>Wonder Woman's character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis forces as well as an assortment of colorful supervillains, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman freeing herself from bondage, which counterpointed the ""damsels in distress"" trope that was common in comics during the 1940s. In the decades since her debut, Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on destroying her, including classic villains such as Ares, Cheetah, Doctor Poison, Circe, Doctor Psycho, and Giganta, along with more recent adversaries such as Veronica Cale and the First Born. Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams Justice Society (from 1941) and Justice League (from 1960).</p><p>The character is an archetypical figure in popular culture that has been adapted to various media. October 21 is Wonder Woman Day, commemorating the release of her first appearance in <i>All Star Comics</i> #8 (with the exception of 2017 which held the day on June 3 to tie in with the release of the film of the same name).</p><p>Wonder Woman has been featured in various media from radio to television and film, and appears in merchandise sold around the world, such as apparel, toys, dolls, jewelry, and video games. Shannon Farnon, Susan Eisenberg, Maggie Q, Lucy Lawless, Keri Russell, Rosario Dawson, Cobie Smulders, Rachel Kimsey and Stana Katic among others, have provided the character's voice for animated adaptations. Wonder Woman has been depicted in both film and television by Cathy Lee Crosby, Lynda Carter, and in the DC Extended Universe films by Gal Gadot. </p>"	byrne pen superhuman superheroine war biological monster classic appears zeus october his over depicted entirely doll around katic q princewonder amazonian first star bondage an cathy dc villain changed 2017 ever appearance posse cheetah destroying justice decade wonder society came emphasis trope blending adapted by 1 relates cale exception in common technology aunt her to all civilian commemorating deity mother charles emphasized radio origin indestructible sculpted power 1940s herself have american athletic held almost writer appearancewonder a depiction device time which artist sometimes look wa william partner on enemy dawson team olive 2011 marstons eisenberg lynda league gadot peter january kimsey bent background perez rosario psycho homeland nation golden release character rachel both late wife shannon gift assortment various same retcon being serf doctor is title when harry daughter that 1941 game published such 21 identity outside distress been losing among range many circe regularly apparel maggie crosby name founding toy with given extended namewonder amazon life animated god clay tiara older stana since 1960the june merchandise voice mythology during item adversary medium psychologist of island 8 bracelet g themyscira their freeing poison into including comic recent book lee russell raised for based menalippe lasso 1980s popular inspiration and giganta antiope queen official supervillains others from force adopts greater colorful sensation she heritage ii fighting princess diana george arsenal damsel place truth appeared tie featured day marston jewelry farnon 1960s television ha gave counterpointed member moulton continuously projectile cobie adaptation world born carter keri 1942 debut gained jointly superhero provided bronze also 3 woman although lucy elizabeth smulders cast veronica axis are age lawless culture briefly gal featuring sold magical more greek initially film the appearing story archetypical along pair figure susan video universe credited well feature hippolyta created	superhero appearing in DC Comics publications and related media	medium and dc comic in superhero publication related appearing	Comics_characters

Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer Charles Reizenstein and artist Stanley Josephs Aschmeier in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in <i>All-American Comics</i> #25 (April 1941). He continued in <i>All-American Comics</i> until issue #102 (Oct 1948).</p><p>Like many Golden Age heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's Justice Society of America. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared as the solo protagonist of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an anthology and a mini-series. </p><p>All three versions of Doctor Mid-Nite have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a crescent moon symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, the use of special visors and “blackout” smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat, a high degree of skill in martial arts, and jobs as physicians serving both normal human beings and ""metahuman"" superheroes. Additionally, two of the doctors have been accompanied by sidekick owls. </p><p>As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of Daredevil of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years. </p><p>Charles McNider made his live-action debut in the second season of <i>Legends of Tomorrow</i> played by Kwesi Ameyaw.

Alan Scott	"<p><b>Alan Scott</b> is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, and the first character to bear the name <b>Green Lantern</b>. He fights evil with the aid of a magical ring which grants him a variety of powers. He was created by Martin Nodell and Bill Finger, first appearing in the comic book <i>All-American Comics</i> #16, published in 1940.</p><p>Alan Scott was created after Nodell became inspired by the characters from Greek, Norse, and Middle Eastern myths and tales, including Aladdin from <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>, and sought to create a popular entertainment character who fought evil with the aid of a magic ring that grants him a variety of supernatural powers. After debuting in <i>All-American Comics</i>, Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, <i>Green Lantern</i>. Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of ""mystery men"" or superheroes in comic books. </p><p>Following World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After eight years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC revisited Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were Green Lanterns on two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One.

Jaguar (Archie Comics)	"<p><b>The Jaguar</b> is a superhero first published in 1961 by Archie Comics. He was created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger as part of Archie's ""Archie Adventure Series"". This happened prior to that comics line being camped up as part of their Mighty Comics imprint. </p><p>The Jaguar is zoologist Ralph Hardy. While on a dig in Peru, (Hardy, like most Silver Age heroes, is a man of many interests and talents, including archeology), a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. While the others fled, Hardy followed a rare white jaguar into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster, as well as a mystical ""nucleon energy belt"". The round golden buckle of the belt had the engraved image of a winged Jaguar on the front and on the back an inscription which read: ""He who loves the animal kingdom may wear this belt and be transformed into a human Jaguar"". Hardy put on the belt and was instantly transformed.</p><p>As The Jaguar, he possesses, in addition to the expected feline abilities, all the powers of the animal kingdom, only a thousand times more powerful. The oft-quoted ""magnified toughness of a rhinoceros' hide"", for example, gives him near Superman-level invulnerability. He also has the Aquaman-style telepathic ability to mentally communicate with and command all animals, including those from alien worlds. </p><p>The Jaguar wears a simple, skintight scarlet bodysuit with a flared black collar and the stylized suggestion of a feline face (just the eyes, whiskers, and open mouth) on the chest and jaguar pelt-patterned boots and nucleon belt. The latter has two small rocket packs on either side which gives him the power of supersonic flight. He wears no mask and looks exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy has a mustache, while The Jaguar does not. (Post-Silver Age comics artists tend to give the latter pointed ears and a more cat-like hairstyle, making him vaguely resemble a cross between the Sub-Mariner and the movie version of Wolverine.) </p><p>In many ways The Jaguar is a copy of earlier Archie Comics hero The Fly: magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than the insect kingdom, etc. The Jaguar first appeared two years after The Fly was introduced. </p><p>Unlike The Fly, however, The Jaguar is handsome and has many recurring romantic entanglements. These include the immortal feline sorceress Cat Girl, who had command over the cat kingdom, just as he ruled over the whole animal kingdom. (She was also known as The Sphinx and had originally battled The Fly, but it was quickly decided that she would be a more appropriate foe for The Jaguar.) There is also the green-skinned and white-haired undersea siren Kree-Nal, and Hardy's secretary Jill Ross. Like Pete Ross, she secretly knows that Hardy is her beloved hero The Jaguar and uses that knowledge to help him without him knowing it. Nor were these relationships static; in later stories, Jill left to study nursing so that she could better assist in Hardy's veterinary work. </p><p>Cat Girl lost her magic powers due to exposure to highly toxic strontium-90 from atomic testing, retaining only her telepathic mastery over cats. She took on the new mortal identity of jet-set socialite Lydia Fellin, whose ""family fortune"" was actually a vast treasure trove that she had accumulated over the centuries. </p><p>The Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of <i>The Adventures of the Jaguar</i>, as well as a backup feature in other Archie titles: <i>Jughead Jones Comic Digest</i> 7; <i>Laugh Comics</i> 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140–142, 144; <i>Laugh Comics Digest</i> 25, 27; <i>Pep Comics</i> 150, 152, 157, 159, and 168. The Jaguar also appears in <i>The Adventures of the Fly</i> #23. When the ""Archie Adventure Series"" line was canceled and reborn as Archie's ""camped up"" Mighty Comics line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in <i>Mighty Crusaders</i> #4 and 5. In #5 The Jaguar would team up with Mr. Justice and Steel Sterling as the ""Terrific Three"". </p><p>The Jaguar would again appear as part of Archie's Red Circle Comics revamp in the 1980s, as a founding member of the new <i>Mighty Crusaders</i>. He was also a backup series in <i>The Fly</i> issues 4–9. In this incarnation it was revealed that the source of The Jaguar's powers was the cherubim-like pre-human god Varigon, Lord of the Animals, a towering golden-winged being with three heads: a bird, a lion, and a bull. Varigon had created the magic belt as a weapon to be worn by his mortal champion in the eternal battle against the scaly green lizard-headed S'ithh, Lord of the Reptiles, who wanted the dinosaurs to rule the Earth once again. The first person to have worn the belt in ancient times was an Incan woman. </p><p>It is later revealed that Ralph is the brother of Rose Raymond, the wife of fellow superhero The Web.</p><p>The most recent appearances of the Ralph Hardy Jaguar have been cameos in <i>Archie's Weird Mysteries</i> #3 and 14 and a cover story crossover appearance in <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i> #30. </p><p>A teenage female version of The Jaguar, written by William Messner-Loebs, was used in DC Comics' <i>Impact</i> revamp of the Archie superheroes. She is naive and good-hearted Maria DeGuzman, who came to North America from Rio de Janeiro to study at Elm Harbor University. To her surprise, she inherited from her late aunt the werewolf-like ability to transform into a large, muscular, barefoot and green-eyed Jaguar. Despite wearing a similar, somewhat skimpier skintight red outfit, unlike her male namesake, this ferocious feline's powers are limited to superhuman strength and agility combined with cat-like claws and senses. She eventually marries Impact's version of The Fly at the end of the <i>Crucible</i> miniseries.</p><p>In the aftermath of the continuity-altering Final Crisis, DC comics once again licensed the Red Circle heroes, this time choosing to bring them directly into the DC Universe. In March 2010 a new Jaguar was set to appear in <i>The Shield</i> #5, a Brazilian man who could transform into a red tattoo-covered ""werejaguar"".</p><p>In <i>New Crusaders</i> the role of The Jaguar in the short-lived Red Circle digital comics universe was passed to Ralph Hardy's young apprentice Ivette ""Ivy"" Velez when the shy, Spanish-speaking orphan was given the cat-like golden helmet of Ai Apaec to become the savage new Jaguar.</p>"	superhuman vast 2010 deguzman his over stylized transformedas entanglement handsome supermanlevel brief ruined scarlet continuityaltering revamp after put archeology left transform john terrific aunt while 7 marries mr archie power read these introduced a better savage archies on most jughead up mystery ai century rose originally backup etc include combined late drawing flared wife hero same sithh being title that published identity 14 version again testing telepathic eventually rare accumulated copy beloved command reborn it study ross giant of ruled mighty into comic assist greenskinned despite winged exactly took apaec from she hairstyle appeared alien fellin 150 once siren maria ha rio made chest claw orphan person also buckle eternal battled ear romantic 1961 tattoocovered latter greeneyed three unlike 27 157 4–9 de feature battle 135 cave appear monster lizardheaded collar crusader used agility serpent first naive except skintight aftermath directly he mask just suggestion came by ivy in near her fled robert have belt university march veterinary revealed nursing forth lydia william team two weird imprint sens crucible series round green set wanted velez ferocious rocket been many pep superheroes given inherited secretly give steel impact brother nor god ivette not work digest head inca mystical jill flight appropriate lord way janeiro 15 rule energy had retaining cover know for trove and somewhat either surprise between front man werewolflike goodhearted member rhinoceros mustache superhero exposure ancient no foe rather area toxic 168 shy love bodysuit began who created hide licensed towering choosing this line him treasure 4 against messnerloebs dc engraved feline scaly appearance only helmet wear mentally image apprentice silver jones submariner to be prior may strontium90 role 159 mouth miniseriesin oftquoted time look young ground tend 130 girl 23 family source whole new witch barefoot animal later final without is spanishspeaking when battling us ring weapon shield male whitehaired limited 152 secretary atomic 140–142 founding cross werejaguarin addition were sorceress reptile communicate boot female prehuman wolverine whisker due knowing other muscular webthe circle including recent actually depicting pack laugh rosenberger 30 highly socialite shortlived temple incarnation 133 would so bull back teenage america sphinx bernstein relationship cat zoologist crossover brazilian age magnified jetset outfit ralph eye supersonic the resemble story year cherubimlike well at but found fortune digital undersea talent appears champion camped harbor bird simple magic goldenwinged north sterling like an skimpier posse justice fellow making immortal earlier instantly all however kreenal cameo white example known crisis lost large peltpatterned instead invulnerability writer fly nucleon which artist pointed wa 25 them varigon decided mastery elm ability mortal transformed golden hardy terrorizing human thousand 127 red knowledge dig static could doe lion written with there issue 131 kingdom raymond part peru earth sabrina quickly jaguar open side vaguely 144 their pete help insect whose namesake recurring strength burst end 1980s movie those others canceled passed inscription expected black interest incan bring world 5 happened aquamanstyle worn 3 face woman small catlike toughness are wearing powerful followed more similar than become postsilver universe adventure dinosaur	superhero published by Archie Comics	archie by comic superhero published	Comics_characters

Salem Saberhagen	<p><b>Salem Saberhagen</b> is a fictional character from the American Archie Comics comic series <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i>. Salem is an American Shorthair cat who lives with Sabrina Spellman, Hilda Spellman and Zelda Spellman in the fictional town of Greendale, located near Riverdale. A formerly human witch, Salem was sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a cat, as punishment for trying to take over the world. Salem first appeared alongside Sabrina in <i>Archie's Mad House</i> #22 in 1962, and was created by George Gladir and Dan DeCarlo. </p><p>Earlier comics portray Salem as a normal orange-colored feline who does not speak. With the debut and success of the 1990s live-action <i>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</i> sitcom, Salem's backstory and character underwent several retcons to bring it more in line with the sitcom's version. A late 1990s story initially revealed Salem was turned into a cat for jilting Enchantra, the Head Witch, at the altar. A similar version of events was presented in a 1990s live-action television film, where he was imprisoned in the form of a cat for attempting to use his magic to make a mortal love him. However, the comics eventually gave Salem a similar backstory that was shown in the sitcom and its spinoff, <i>Sabrina: The Animated Series</i>. Further details about Salem's past before his transformation into a cat were revealed in the 2000s manga-inspired version of the comic, written and drawn by Tania del Rio.</p><p>In the graphic novel <i>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i>, Salem is given a more serious role to fit with the series' darker tone. In this version, Salem often acts as a conscience to Sabrina, questioning her hot-headed or more daring ideas. </p>	house conscience speak trying his over this often or line gladir him zelda attempting magic first an altar fit town feline he greendale at about by in near riverdale to earlier form her however role archie american before past located revealed a archies wa rioin imprisoned normal orangecolored further 22 where portray series mortal success character mangainspired late use witch human is graphic that idea version 2000s doe eventually punishment written with 1990s drawn given sentenced tania life animated were it not sabrina head of 100 into comic enchantra presented alongside for make spellman del and council 1962 from transformation jilting novel underwent george retcons appeared sitcom several mad hilda television gave fictional dan bring world teenage take formerly debut spinoff cat darker act spend liveaction shorthair turned shown saberhagen more similar initially film hotheaded event tone the story serious year questioning love detail backstory daring adventure decarlo chilling who created salem	fictional character from Sabrina the Teenage Witch	teenage from character sabrina fictional witch the	Comics_characters

Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog	"<p><b>Rang-a-Tang the Wonder Dog</b> is a fictional canine adventure hero who appeared in <i>Blue Ribbon Comics</i>, published from 1939 to 1942 by MLJ Comics (later renamed Archie Comics) during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The character was created by writer Norman Danberg and artist Will Harr, although another creative team, writer Joe Blair and artist Ed Smalle, produced most of his adventures.</p><p>Rang-a-Tang is a circus-trained German shepherd who solves crimes at a movie studio in Hollywood, California, with the help of detective Hy Speed and former child actor Richy the Amazing Boy. The unusually intelligent dog, described as having an ""almost-human brain"", can understand human speech, including the person's tone of voice and moral character. He was inspired by the famous canine silent film star Rin Tin Tin, a real-life German Shepherd considered intelligent and talented. When Rang-a-Tang reaches Hollywood in issue #5, his stories feature thinly-disguised caricatures of 1940s film stars, including Nawson Swelles, Tana Lurner, Stark Brable and Harly Shaplyn. </p><p>Rang-a-Tang was the first cover star of <i>Blue Ribbon Comics</i> and therefore the first in Archie Comics' long history, premiering in issue #1 (Nov 1939) and running through the end of the title, issue #22 (March 1942).

The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero Batman. The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in <i>Detective Comics</i> #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. Robin's early adventures included <i>Star Spangled Comics</i> #65–130 (1947–1952), the character's first solo feature. He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s, until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing. As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the <i>Caped Crusaders</i> and the <i>Dynamic Duo</i>.</p><p>The character's second incarnation, Jason Todd, first appeared in <i>Batman</i> #357 (1983). He made regular appearances in Batman-related comic books until 1988, when he was murdered by the Joker in the storyline ""A Death in the Family"" (1989). Jason later found himself alive after a reality-changing incident, eventually becoming the Red Hood. The premiere <i>Robin</i> limited series was published in 1991, featuring the character's third incarnation, Tim Drake, training to earn the role of Batman's vigilante partner. After two successful sequels, the monthly <i>Robin</i> series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character Stephanie Brown became the fourth Robin for a short time before the role reverted to Tim Drake. Damian Wayne succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc ""Battle for the Cowl."" </p><p>The current and former Robins always feature prominently in Batman's cast of supporting heroes; Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian all regard him as a father. In current continuity as of 2021, Dick Grayson serves as Nightwing, Jason Todd is the Red Hood, Stephanie Brown is Batgirl, and Tim Drake has picked up the mantle of Robin again after a stint as Red Robin. Damian has left behind the title Robin, but remains the title character of the <i>Robin</i> comic book.

Red Hood	"<p>The <b>Red Hood</b> is an alias used by multiple characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The identity was first used in the 1951 storyline ""The Man Behind The Red Hood!"", which provides the earliest origin story for the Joker. The storyline depicts an unnamed criminal wearing a red dome-shaped hood who, after a chance encounter with Batman, is disfigured by chemicals and becomes insane, giving birth to his future Joker persona. </p><p>Five decades later, the identity was used again in the 2005–2006 story arc, <i>Batman: Under the Hood</i>, in which Jason Todd, Batman's second crime-fighting partner who had been killed by the Joker, comes back to life as a violent vigilante, using his killer's former alias. Since his return, Jason operates as the Red Hood in the main DC Comics continuity. In <i>The New 52</i>, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, one storyline introduces a criminal organization called the Red Hood Gang, and retroactively establishes the Joker (prior to his transformation) as its former leader, and Jason as a former member. </p><p>Both the Joker and Jason Todd incarnations of the Red Hood, as well as the Red Hood Gang, have been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics, such as films, television series, and video games. </p>"	come his used chance gang first an dc encounter killed after retroactively adapted decade by in to form depicts prior origin former have american a one which wa partner 2011 unnamed batman provides series alias both character new later insane 2005–2006 is disfigured red game published such identity joker outside violent again been with return continuity life main since hood birth it reboot crimefighting medium of criminal leader persona into comic becomes book future had behind 52 domeshaped for and vigilante under operates multiple transformation incarnation 1951 man second several jason establishes television back giving member earliest organization using wearing film the appearing story introduces called chemical universe video arc five well killer storyline who todd	alias used by multiple fictional characters and a criminal organization	a organization and by multiple alias used character criminal fictional	Comics_characters

The original version was created to serve as the titular villain of Rocksteady Studios' 2015 video game <i>Batman: Arkham Knight</i>, in which he is voiced by Troy Baker. He first appeared in the debut issue of the prequel comic book of the same name in March 2015. </p><p>The Arkham Knight is introduced as the mysterious leader of a vast militia of mercenaries who harbors a deep-rooted grudge against Batman. He allies with the Scarecrow and provides a military presence in the evacuated Gotham City. Towards the end of the game's main story, the Arkham Knight is revealed to be <b>Jason Todd</b>, the former and second Robin adapted from the mainstream DC Comics. In the game's continuity, Todd was thought to have been killed years earlier by the Joker, but was actually tortured and driven insane in Arkham Asylum. </p><p>The Arkham Knight persona was later adapted into the mainstream comics in <i>Detective Comics</i> #1000 in March 2019.

Nightwing	<p><b>Nightwing</b> is a fictional character and superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character has appeared in various incarnations; the identity was adopted by <b>Dick Grayson</b> when he left his role as Batman's vigilante partner Robin. </p><p>Although Nightwing is commonly associated with Batman, the title and concept have origins in classic Superman stories. The original Nightwing in DC Comics was an identity assumed by alien superhero Superman when stranded on the Kryptonian city of Kandor with his friend Jimmy Olsen. Drawing inspiration from Batman and Robin, the two protect Kandor as the superheroes Nightwing and Flamebird. Following the <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> continuity reboot in 1985, Nightwing was re-imagined as a legendary vigilante from Krypton whose story inspires Dick Grayson's choice of name when he leaves behind his Robin identity. </p><p>Other stories set among the <i>Batman</i> family of characters have seen acquaintances and friends of Grayson briefly assume the title, including his fellow Robin alumnus Jason Todd. Meanwhile, <i>Superman</i> stories have seen Superman's adopted son Chris Kent and Power Girl take up the name for brief turns as Nightwing. Various other characters have taken the name in stories set outside DC's main continuity as well. </p><p>In 2013, Nightwing placed 5th on IGN's Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics and Grayson as Nightwing was ranked the #1 Sexiest Male Character in Comics by ComicsAlliance in 2013.</p>	classic meanwhile choice inspires his 2013 sexiest brief an assume dc protect igns 5th he comicsalliance left fellow by robin 1 in grayson role associated origin alumnus power crisis nightwing have reimagined american leaf kandor various a on infinite wa partner 25 up two girl family batman acquaintance character drawing 1985 hero taken is title when set kryptonian published identity outside male legendary among flamebird name superheroes commonly with continuity main son seen adopted jimmy earth reboot following of other superman graysons ranked including comic book behind whose concept friend for inspiration and vigilante from incarnation appeared alien jason ha kent fictional stranded turn take olsen krypton placed top superhero assumed although city briefly chris original the appearing story dick well todd	DC Comics superhero	comic superhero dc	Comics_characters
Batgirl	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Batgirl</b> is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, depicted as female counterparts to the superhero Batman. Although the character Betty Kane was introduced into publication in 1961 by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff as Bat-Girl, she was replaced by Barbara Gordon in 1967, who later came to be identified as the iconic Batgirl. The character debuted in <i>Detective Comics</i> #359 (January 1967) by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino, introduced as the daughter of police commissioner James Gordon. </p><p>Batgirl operates in Gotham City, allying herself with Batman and the original Robin, Dick Grayson, along with other masked vigilantes. The character appeared regularly in <i>Detective Comics</i>, <i>Batman Family</i>, and several other books produced by DC until 1988. That year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Barbara Kesel's <i>Batgirl Special</i> #1, in which she retires from crime-fighting. She subsequently appeared in Alan Moore's graphic novel <i>Batman: The Killing Joke</i> where, in her civilian identity, she is shot by the Joker and left paraplegic. Although she is reimagined as the computer expert and information broker Oracle by editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander the following year, her paralysis sparked debate about the portrayal of women in comics, particularly violence depicted toward female characters. </p><p>In the 1999 storyline ""No Man's Land"", the character Helena Bertinelli, known as Huntress, briefly assumes the role of Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman for violating his stringent codes. Within the same storyline, the character Cassandra Cain is introduced. Cain is written as the daughter of assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva and takes the mantle of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, in addition to becoming one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was canceled in 2006, at which point during the company-wide storyline ""One Year Later"", she is established as a villain and head of the League of Assassins. After receiving harsh feedback from readership, she is later restored to her original conception. However, the character Stephanie Brown, originally known as Spoiler and later Robin, succeeds her as Batgirl after Cassandra Cain abandons the role. </p><p>Stephanie Brown became the featured character of the <i>Batgirl</i> series from 2009 to 2011, prior to DC's The New 52 relaunch, which established Barbara Gordon recovering from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and starring as the title character of <i>Batgirl</i> once again. Barbara later returned to the Oracle role with Infinite Frontier in 2020, and currently operates as both Batgirl and Oracle, with Cassandra and Stephanie also serving as Batgirls. The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics, expressed that Barbara is the best-known version of the character. </p>"	toward cain appear 359 descent abandon his depicted 2020 first star brown an dc villain returned kane stringent after adapted at left came particularly betty about by robin 1 portrayal in john her to be civilian prior stephanie however grayson role moore information known mantle herself joke reimagined didio american monthly expressed relaunch introduced writer allying a surgical various one which artist infinite most wa shiva 2009 2011 league police debuted batman january family killing where assassin spoiler receiving originally batgirl ostrander huntress series both detective character 2000 gotham new asian later same moldoff is sparked title copublisher graphic daughter restored relating that game published eponymous recovering identity helena batgirls 1967 joker becoming version prominent again been regularly name written fox with animation established finger conception addition iconic readership became merchandise crimefighting during code head until female retires alan following infantino barbara medium james of oracle debate procedure special other point counterpart into including comic book sheldon 52 shot lady yale bertinelli for violating 2006 stripped and carmine vigilante kim operates under masked gardner produced from assumes bestknown she novel violence land canceled featured man appeared feedback several identified starring once within television publication ha 1999 fictional dan gordon editor guidance take serving cassandra expert superhero succeeds also 1988 woman although superheroines city kesels harsh broker no briefly 1961 paralysis original companywide franchise film the appearing commissioner replaced dick year along video frontier computer david storyline who subsequently bill paraplegic currently	name of several fictional characters appearing in comic books published by DC Comics	several by of dc comic in name book character published fictional appearing	Comics_characters

It is found along the shores of the northern Pacific Ocean from Central California to Alaska, across the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula and south to Japan. It inhabits the lower intertidal and subtidal zones of rocky coastlines. The gumboot chiton's appearance has led some tidepoolers to refer to it, fondly, as the ""wandering meatloaf"".

Windowpane oyster	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>windowpane oyster</b> (<i>Placuna placenta</i>) is a bivalve marine mollusk in the family of Placunidae. They are edible, but valued more for their shells (and the rather small pearls). The shells have been used for thousands of years as a glass substitute because of their durability and translucence. More recently, they have been used in the manufacture of decorative items such as chandeliers and lampshades; in this use, the shell is known as <b>capiz shell</b> (<i>kapis</i>). Capiz shells are also used as raw materials for glue, chalk and varnish. </p><p>Distribution extends from the shallows of the Gulf of Aden to around the Philippines, where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. The mollusks are found in muddy or sandy shores, in bays, coves and lagoons to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft). </p><p>Populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling, dredging, blast fishing and surface-supplied diving. In the Philippines, fisheries are now regulated through permits, quotas, size limits and protected habitats. In spite of this, resources continue to be depleted.</p><p>The nearly flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm (5.9 in) in diameter, reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm (2.8 to 3.9 in). The shell is secured by a V-shaped ligament. Males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads. Fertilization is external and larvae are free-swimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis, eventually settling on the bottom. They consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell; the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide.</p>"	found lagoon this or over used settling tide aden protected around fishery extends like 330 manufacture spite diving slightly about by in maturity to translucence be decorative they material chalk oyster regulated low permit known passing opened have marine ligament ft varnish 59 limit a on surfacesupplied close chandelier fertilization because above resource fishing family where use larva gulf abundant attached glass thousand filtered is eponymous durability such 28 mollusk 14 windowpane m male substitute bivalve been eventually mm valued population province vshaped blast color muddy philippine can reaching external it gonad thread depth quota item during depletedthe female destructive of via shore 100 gathering their method secured sandy placunidae for diameter decline continue and pearl trawling if from plankton through freeswimming between 39 grow distribution 150 day now nearly shell habitat placuna bay capiz consume placenta byssal size raw also 70 edible small kapis flat glue are cove water more rather distinguished shallow surface the bottom dredging year recently lampshade metamorphosis but	species of mollusc	of mollusc specie	Foods

It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus <i>Sepioteuthis</i>. Studies in 1993, however, have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex. The species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species. </p><p>Bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle, giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish. They are small to medium-sized squids, averaging 3.8 to 33 centimetres (1.5 to 13.0 in) in length. They exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in May, but it can vary by location. The paralarvae resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching. Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate, reaching 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months. They are a short-lived species, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days. </p><p>The diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish. They are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant. They are commonly found near the shoreline, near rocks, and coral reefs. They are fished extensively for human consumption in Asia. Because of their rapid growth rate, short life span, and tolerance to handling and captivity, bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture.

Croatian cuisine	<p><b>Croatian cuisine</b> is heterogeneous and is known as a cuisine of the regions, since every region of Croatia has its own distinct culinary tradition. Its roots date back to ancient times. The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier Slavic and the more recent contacts with Hungarian and Turkish cuisine, using lard for cooking, and spices such as black pepper, paprika, and garlic. The coastal region bears the influences of the Greek and Roman cuisine, as well as of the later Mediterranean cuisine, in particular Italian (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use olive oil, herbs and spices such as rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and lemon and orange rind. Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several basic ingredients (cereals, dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices. Charcuterie is part of the Croatian culinary tradition in all regions. Food and recipes from other former Yugoslav countries are also popular in Croatia. </p><p>Croatian cuisine can be divided into several distinct cuisines (Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, Gorski Kotar, Istria, Lika, Međimurje, Podravina, Slavonija, Zagorje) each of which has specific cooking traditions, characteristic for the area and not necessarily well known in other parts of Croatia.

It shares characteristics with other Balkan cuisines. Bulgarian cooking traditions are diverse because of geographical factors such as climatic conditions suitable for a variety of vegetables, herbs, and fruit. Aside from the vast variety of local Bulgarian dishes, Bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with Persian, Turkish, and Greek cuisine. </p><p>Bulgarian food often incorporates salads as appetizers and is also noted for the prominence of dairy products, wines and other alcoholic drinks such as rakia. The cuisine also features a variety of soups, such as the cold soup tarator, and pastries, such as the filo dough based banitsa, pita, and the various types of burek. </p><p>Main courses are very typically water-based stews, either vegetarian or with lamb, goat meat, veal, chicken or pork. Deep-frying is not common, but grilling – especially different kinds of sausages – is very prominent. Pork is common, often mixed with veal or lamb, although fish and chicken are also widely used. While most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, veal is popular for grilling meat appetizers (meze) and in some main courses. As a substantial exporter of lamb, Bulgaria's own consumption is notable, especially in the spring.</p><p>Similarly to other Balkan cultures, the per capita consumption of yogurt (Bulgarian: кисело мляко, <i>kiselo mlyako, lit.</i> ""sour milk"") among Bulgarians is traditionally higher than the rest of Europe. The country is notable as the historical namesake for <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, a microorganism chiefly responsible for the local variety of dairy product.</p><p>Bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with Middle Eastern cuisine, including popular dishes like moussaka, gyuvetch, kyufte and baklava. White brine cheese called ""sirene"" (сирене), similar to feta, is also a popular ingredient used in salads and a variety of pastries. </p><p>Holidays are often observed in conjunction with certain meals. On Christmas Eve, for instance, tradition requires vegetarian stuffed peppers and cabbage leaf sarmi, New Year's Eve usually involves cabbage dishes, Nikulden (Day of St. Nicholas, December 6) fish (usually carp), while Gergyovden (Day of St. George, May 6) is typically celebrated with roast lamb. </p>"	sour variety vast veal responsible мляко often or used higher lit waterbased goat roast like food typically burek very rakia exporter certain christmas grilling appetizer springsimilarly st production tarator common in while to turkish mixed may wine white per microorganism observed holiday noted representative leaf rest southeast various a salad bǎlgarska on most pepper cabbage because sarmi diverse herb instance dairy product meat romanized new usually milk сирене fish is vegetarian baklava kiselo such кисело cuisine stew prominent mlyako among traditionally involves course december with main widely but chicken meal carp number it bulgarian not condition nicholas pita eastern alcoholic some bulgaria incorporates of notable productbulgarian cooking local own caput gergyovden nikulden filo – type other fruit banitsa bred persian balkan factor including chiefly consumption namesake prominence kind kyufte dough for based lamb popular moussaka and 6 either from bulgaricus brine eve characteristic george requires day lactobacillus tradition pork cattle conjunction sausage cold българска gyuvetch cheese dish europe meze vegetable also especially although are feta deepfrying culture suitable yogurt ingredient geographical similar greek rather than substantial the country drink climatic different middle year called кухня kuhnja historical stuffed feature soup pastry aside celebrated share sirene	culinary traditions of Bulgaria	bulgaria of culinary tradition	Foods

Strained yogurt	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><b>Strained yogurt</b>, <b>Greek yogurt</b>, <b>yogurt cheese</b>, <b>sack yogurt</b>, or <b>kerned yogurt</b> is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than normal unstrained yogurt, while still preserving the distinctive sour taste of yogurt. Like many types, strained yogurt is often made from milk enriched by boiling off some water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free cow's milk. In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made. </p><p>Strained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as ""Greek yogurt"" and in the UK as ""Greek-style yogurt"", though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine, Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian cuisines, where it is often used in cooking, as it curdles less readily when cooked. It is used in a variety of dishes, cooked or raw, savory or sweet. Straining makes even nonfat varieties thicker, richer, and creamier than unstrained. Since straining removes the whey, more milk is required to make strained yogurt, increasing the production cost. Thickeners such as pectin, locust bean gum, starches or guar gum may also be used to thicken yogurts. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the lactose, strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.</p><p>It was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion American yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as ""Greek yogurt"".

Caffè d'orzo	"<p><i><b>Caffè d'orzo</b></i> (<small>pronounced </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"">[kafˌfɛ dˈdɔrdzo]</span>, Italian for ""coffee of barley"", often shortened to simply <b>orzo</b>) or <b>barley coffee</b> is a type of hot drink, originating in Italy. Orzo is a caffeine-free roasted grain beverage made from ground barley (<i>orzo</i> in Italian, from Latin <i>hordeum</i>). It is an espresso-style drink, and when prepared from the roasted barley directly, it can easily be made in typical espresso machines and coffeemakers. In Italy it is widely available in coffee vending machines. Although traditionally considered a coffee substitute for children, it is an increasingly common choice in Italy and other places for those who choose to eschew caffeine for health reasons. </p><p>In Italy caffè d'orzo is made in traditional Italian espresso machines in cafes. Italian families tend, instead, to make it using an orziera, a special moka pot adapted to barley. </p><p>During World War II and in post-war times, caffè d'orzo and chicory became the most popular drinks in Europe. They were both used as substitutes for coffee, which was expensive and hard to find. In European countries with a very long post-war period, like for instance Spain, this image of barley as a cheap surrogate of coffee still remains in the memory of the population. Thus, from having dozens of Spanish producers in the 1950s and being a widely popular drink in the Spanish Mediterranean coast, now Spain only has two roasters of barley. In Italy, instead, there are dozens of roasters making caffè d'orzo and it is a very popular drink. Outside of Italy the consumption of caffè d'orzo as a healthy drink is also increasing slowly, especially in Germany. </p><p>A variety called <i>café de cebada</i> (""coffee of barley"") in Spanish and simply <i>Cevada</i> in Portuguese is available in Latin American markets, though it is often more of a roasted barley tea than a coffee-like beverage. Instant roasted barley drinks are sold under various brand names (although most of them are made with a mix of cereals, not only barley) such as Caro (Europe, New Zealand), Pero (Switzerland, US) and Barleycup (UK), among others. Recently, actual Italian ground roasted barley has begun to be imported into the US by Café Orzo and UK by Orzo Coffee. </p>"	war variety choice memory italy machine chicory this often or used uk coffeelike market like an caffeine orzo directly roaster very only still beverage adapted image choose expensive making café by in common coffee to be producer cereal hot they shortened considered american instead having originating simply a time increasing various which zealand most wa 1950s them ground tend two family instance remains dozen both grain coast new caro caffeinefree being is when spanish instant such pot outside espresso moka substitute pero traditionally among begun kafˌfɛ name population with healthy there child widely coffeemakers can were germany it became not switzerland hordeum italian u pronounced during vending thus eschew health of special hard type brand imported other increasingly long tea orziera barleycup into barley consumption dˈdɔrdzo caffè for make popular espressostyle and dorzo those under cevada others from ii cafe portuguese place latin reason postwar prepared now actual easily ha slowly cebada european spain world made period typical traditional europe also especially available although are using mediterranean surrogate sold more than the country drink recently called find though mix de who cheap roasted	Type of hot drink originating in Italy	drink hot italy of type in originating	Foods

Kvikk Lunsj	"<p><i><b>Kvikk Lunsj</b></i> (Norwegian: <i>Quick Lunch</i>) is the name of a chocolate bar that was launched by the Norwegian chocolate sweets manufacturing company, Freia, in 1937 and has been sold ever since — with the exception of a period during and after WWII. Between 1941 and 1949, production was halted due to a shortage of sugar and the lack of quality flour. The chocolate consists of four rectangular wafers covered in milk chocolate, with thinner layers of filler made from ground up discarded wafers and bars mixed with chocolate that is put between wafers in order to break the chocolate into pieces easier. The chocolate has been advertised as a ""hiking chocolate"", and it is often associated with skiing trips in Norwegian culture, especially during Easter vacation, where chocolate is often used to provide extra energy in packed lunches. Kvikk Lunsj is today owned and produced by Mondelez International and sold in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. </p><p>In the course of one year, the average Norwegian eats nine Kvikk Lunsj chocolates. Three of these are on average consumed during Easter. 50 million bars are produced each year, of which between 400 and 500 tons are sold during Easter. A sizable proportion of sales are made in duty-free shops in Sweden and Denmark. </p><p>For many, Kvikk Lunsj has become a symbol of Norwegian culture, and there were therefore strong reactions when Freia replaced the packaging foil with an airtight packaging in 2005, in line with Freia's other chocolates. The packaging had been largely unchanged since 1938, and when the packaging was replaced, Facebook groups were created to show opposition. In the 1960s, Freia began printing the well-known Fjellvettreglene (Norwegian: <i>the mountain code</i>) on the back of the packaging.</p> "	2005 mountain average halted often used line lunch hiking an four discarded wellknown shortage after ever packed put skiing by sugar trip exception production in wwii to mixed symbol opposition associated sweet quality launched quick fjellvettreglene these packaging a one on lack which piece wa foil facebook wafer ground up 1938 chocolate consists norwegian lunsj where sale dutyfree today milk group freias easier is — each when order that 1941 million airtight been many consumed course name eats mondelez with there shop therefore were since filler it printing unchanged during code vacation easter of covered layer 400 due norway owned 50 other energy into sweden strong proportion had advertised denmark reaction for manufacturing and ton produced from freia 1949 kvikk between break 1960s ha show back company 500 1937 made period largely especially provide are culture extra international sold rectangular three sizable the flour become replaced thinner year nine began bar created	brand of chocolate bar	bar chocolate brand of	Foods

Sardar Udham	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p><i><b>Sardar Udham</b></i> is a 2021 Indian Hindi-language biographical historical drama film directed by Shoojit Sircar, and produced by Rising Sun Films in collaboration with Kino Works. The screenplay is written by Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Ritesh Shah, with Bhattacharya also writing the story, and Shah also writing the dialogues, while playing a supporting role. Based on the life of Udham Singh, a freedom fighter from Punjab who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in London to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, the film starred Vicky Kaushal in the titular role, along with Shaun Scott, Stephen Hogan, Amol Parashar, Banita Sandhu and Kirsty Averton in supporting roles. </p><p>Shoojit Sircar pitched the idea of Udham Singh's biopic during his college days, and planned to produce the film in his mid-1990s, but the research work on the freedom fighter took him two long decades. It was eventually supposed to be made with Irrfan Khan in the titular role, but was latter offered to Kaushal as Khan stepped out due to health conditions. The film was officially announced in March 2019, with principal photography began on April. In a marathon schedule of 6–7 months, spanning four climatic seasons, the makers completed the shooting of the film during December 2019. The makers shot the film in major portions of Russia and India, while also filming few sequences in United Kingdom and Ireland.</p><p><i>Sardar Udham</i> features musical score composed by Shantanu Moitra, cinematography handled by Avik Mukhopadhyay and editing done by Chandrashekhar Prajapati. Initially being delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the makers headed for a direct-to-digital premiere through the streaming service Amazon Prime Video, surpassing theatrical release. The film released on 16 October 2021, during the Dusshera weekend and eventually received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed on Kaushal's performance, direction, screenplay, cinematography, dialogues and technical aspects, but it received some criticism aimed at the film's lengthy runtime. The film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, being depicted in an extended and graphic sequence. <i>Forbes</i> named <i>Sardar Udham</i> 2021’s Best Hindi film with a social message.</p> <!-- NewPP limit report Parsed by mw1450 Cached time: 20220514225119 Cache expiry: 3600 Reduced expiry: true Complications: [vary‐revision‐sha1, vary‐revision‐exists] CPU time usage: 0.250 seconds Real time usage: 0.338 seconds Preprocessor visited node count: 1137/1000000 Post‐expand include size: 20774/2097152 bytes Template argument size: 2852/2097152 bytes Highest expansion depth: 23/100 Expensive parser function count: 4/500 Unstrip recursion depth: 0/20 Unstrip post‐expand size: 6415/5000000 bytes Lua time usage: 0.138/10.000 seconds Lua memory usage: 3838676/52428800 bytes Number of Wikibase entities loaded: 0/400 --> <!-- Transclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template) 100.00% 316.993 1 -total 36.15% 114.580 1 Template:Infobox_film 30.15% 95.558 1 Template:Infobox 27.35% 86.692 3 Template:Cite_news 24.52% 77.725 1 Template:Short_description 12.04% 38.166 1 Template:Pagetype 11.74% 37.205 8 Template:Main_other 6.98% 22.113 1 Template:Use_dmy_dates 6.39% 20.258 7 Template:If_empty 5.36% 16.989 1 Template:SDcat -->"	supposed lockdown october his hindilanguage 2019 depicted criticism avik him lengthy maker composed shoojit season marathon an biographical aimed vicky four acclaim announced michael collaboration shooting united khan shaun decade at message sardar parashar avenge by portrayal kaushal in schedule streaming while to be ritesh irrfan role rising premiere hindi supporting assassinated pandemic march noted drama bagh stepped a time biopic on major spanning college wa playing aspect forbes 16 two few praise prime completed 2021 starred russia mukhopadhyay release mid1990s musical being fighter is done editing graphic amol idea irelandsardar ’ titular eventually massacre realistic freedom surpassing december written released with extended bhattacharya handled service life kingdom amazon portion critical performance writing odwyer weekend month it work received condition during chandrashekhar principal direction some health india of pitched score due kaushals jallianwala stephen long scott dusshera s shubhendu offered cinematography widespread shot for based kirsty took and multiple produced from sequence technical through indian banita covid19 day singh 1919 6–7 sun best shah out officially london made research headed also averton produce runtime udham social directtodigital sandhu photography prajapati amritsar april named latter hogan screenplay film punjab directed initially delayed the story sircar singhs along climatic moitra historical video filming kino theatrical began feature who but planned dialogue shantanu	Hindi language film	language film hindi	Monuments_and_memorials

The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations. </p><p>While many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties. </p> <p>Markers in Manila were first to be installed, following the establishment of the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee (PHRMC), the earliest predecessor of the NHCP. These were markers installed in 1934 for Church of San Agustin, Fort Santiago, Plaza McKinley, Roman Catholic Cathedral of Manila, San Sebastian Church, Concordia College, Manila Railroad Company, Dr. Lorenzo Negrao, and University of Santo Tomas (Intramuros site). The installation of markers were first limited to identify antiquities in Manila. Many markers were destroyed or lost due to World War II, along with the structures they represent, and many have been replaced by post-war markers. </p><p>In 2002, during the unveiling ceremony of the marker National Federation of Women's Club in the Philippines in Manila Hotel, former president Fidel Ramos joked that the curtain raising reminded him of striptease, and everybody laughed. That was the last time that the curtains were pulled upward, and from then, the unveiling has involved curtain pulling instead.</p><p>Following the move to relocate the marker of the first shot of the Filipino-American War from San Juan Bridge to the corner of Sociego and Silencio, Santa Mesa, Manila, former NHI Chairperson Ambeth Ocampo was declared <i>persona non grata</i> in San Juan. The NHCP then issued a replacement marker on the bridge, indicating it as a boundary between Filipino and American soldiers during the war, instead of it being the site of the first shot.</p><p>The marker concerning the First Congress of the Republic of the Philippines 1946-1949 was the biggest marker made, measuring at 52x72 inches. The 1946 marker was replaced on January 27, 2010 when governor Carlos Padilla of Nueva Vizcaya asked why his father, Constancio Padilla was missing from the list of the legislators. Luis Taruc, Jesus Lava, and Amado Yuson of the Democratic Alliance were not in the marker even though they appeared in the Congressional Records, while Luis Clarin, Carlos Fortich, and Narciso Ramos were in the 1946 marker, but not in the present Congressional Records. The Taruc, Lava, and Yuzon were dismissed from Congress, although the latter moved to the Nacionalista Party.

In response, Teresita Ang-See, said that the memorial should not become an insult versus Japan. On April 27, 2018, the DPWH removed the memorial for a drainage improvement project along the Baywalk. Many individuals and groups, including Gabriela Women's Party condemned the removal, stating historical revisionism and submission to Japanese policy. They also stated that this has been an unlawful removal, since the heritage act protects markers and memorials by the NHCP. President Duterte remarked that the memorial can be placed in a private property, since the state would not want to ""antagonize"" other countries.</p><p>This article lists five hundred ten (511) markers from the National Capital Region. </p>"	lava indicating building 2010 escolta policy governor his informing grata individual publicly cipriano pulling commission 2017 after insult 5th stating phrmc while 19461949 52x72 condemned american congressional these private a unveiling on revisionism ramos global demolition completed article missing centennial capital unlawful won father being 2014 that million 28 democratic attention regarding permanent appointed 1939 raising site can it remedios of 8 destroyed federation into roxas identify shot said highway took people from moved ana bonifacio appeared laughed last ha stolen fort metro made dismissed plaque research railroad also earliest sociego taruc ignaciana latter move 27 concordia replaced historical church sebastian insteadfollowing agustin alliance installed dedicated term even first countriesthis dr club by yuzon legislator in 1934 they have negrao university chairperson before 2018 malate involved congress luis corner region stated build asked 80th been many december themselves tomas filipinoamerican nacionalista jesuit temporarily since record not work revival silencio during want predecessor pulled soldier comfort widow persona amado ocampo catholic protects location for and movement property japan ii hundred completing between clarin 2002 curtain pangasinan placed wrote inch act statue party although then removal april versus present surface why submission vizcaya social planned never respectively this or cathedral measuring him shotthe district intramuros ozamis 511 united striptease republic to be bridge former occasion renovated time nhcp entitled plaza january anniversary sign foreign roman group duterte hotel without is done when affair lorenzo informed ceremony report limited committee santa la non memorare filipina manila mariano project remarked philippine were antagonize restoration issued jesus memorial following remembering local special due other category approval including business particular ten official dpwh allotted reminded would afterdays place day postwar company soon san castiron everybody nueva antiquity derelict baywalk 2015 replacement event the patricio along joked though embassy represent juan at but mckinley seeking boundary war marker constancio biggest binondo died an protect concerning death unit filipino marianos narciso marked nhi visible park angsee all institution however connecting lost instead 2020a annotated monument santo construction one public college wa declared establishment nation japanese government state carlos cultural structure drainage with gabriela padilla makati 1946 caught ambeth installation received president boulevard removed medium list should end ortigas department heritage teresita congressman santiago national fortich ₱39 commemorated response world relocate situation fidel woman city are designated upward become mesa allasthe yuson five improvement	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Monuments_and_memorials

Tombstone of Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera	"<p><b>Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera</b> (<span></span>; c. 22 BC – AD 40) was a Roman-Phoenician soldier born in Sidon, whose tombstone was found in Bingerbrück, Germany, in 1859. A historical connection from this soldier to Jesus has long been hypothesized by numerous scholars, based on the claim of the ancient Greek philosopher Celsus, who, according to Christian writer Origen in his ""Against Celsus"" (Greek Κατὰ Κέλσου, <i>Kata Kelsou</i>; Latin <i>Contra Celsum</i>), was the author of a work entitled <i>The True Word</i> (Greek Λόγος Ἀληθής, <i>Logos Alēthēs</i>). </p><p>Celsus' work was lost but, in Origen's account of it, Jesus was depicted as the result of an affair between his mother Mary and a Roman soldier. He said she was ""convicted of adultery and had a child by a certain soldier named Panthera"". According to James Tabor, Tiberius Pantera could have been serving in the region at the time of Jesus's conception. Both the ancient Talmud and medieval Jewish writings and sayings reinforced this notion, referring to ""Yeshu ben Pantera"", which translates as ""Jesus, son of Pantera"". Tabor's hypothesis is considered highly unlikely by mainstream scholars given that there is little other evidence to support Pantera's paternity outside of the Greek and Jewish texts.</p><p>Historically, the name Pantera is not unusual and was in use among Roman soldiers.</p>"	found adultery true tombstone his this abdes reinforced connection depicted tiberius against word an tabor kata kelsou origen he certain at by unusual christian in to mother convicted lost have considered unlikely little c celsus writer a time on which 40 wa entitled numerous hypothesized 22 talmud ben both use roman mainstream textshistorically is region scholar ἀληθής affair that logo yeshu according could outside been alēthēs contra 1859 among panthera name bingerbrück given there child julius conception son hypothesis writing germany it work not medieval jesus result soldier james of notion paternity – other long κέλσου philosopher jewish had claim author account whose highly based said κατὰ and saying translates from evidence she between latin celsum ha referring panteras born serving λόγος ancient bc support ad romanphoenician named greek mary pantera the sidon historical who but	Roman soldier of the Cohors I Sagittariorum (c. 22 BC - AD 40)	roman 22 ad soldier cohors of i 40 c bc sagittariorum the	Monuments_and_memorials

Linné (crater)	<p><b>Linné</b> is a small lunar impact crater located in the western Mare Serenitatis. It was named after Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. The mare around this feature is virtually devoid of other features of interest. The nearest named crater is Banting to the east-southeast. The estimated age of this copernican crater is only a few tens of millions of years. It was earlier believed to have a bowl shape, but data from the LRO showed that it has a shape of a flattened, inverted cone. The crater is surrounded by a blanket of ejecta formed during the original impact. This ejecta has a relatively high albedo, making the feature appear bright. </p> <p>In 1824 Wilhelm Lohrmann (1786-1840) of Dresden had drawn Linné as an 8 km diameter crater in his acclaimed lunar atlas, and in 1837 Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler had described Linne in <i>Der Mond</i> as a 10 km crater. In 1866, the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt made the surprising claim that Linné had changed its appearance. Instead of a normal, somewhat deep crater it had become a mere white patch. A controversy arose that continued for many decades. However, this crater size tests the limit of visual perception of Earth-based telescopes. In conditions of poor seeing this feature can appear to vanish from sight (see also transient lunar phenomenon). </p>	appear described observer his this continued acclaimed transient around an sight changed crater after relatively mere appearance only decade by making in nearest to earlier lohrmann 1866 however linné bright white have devoid heinrich bowl instead der dresden located limit a mädler mapmaker wa estimated normal lunar mare swedish few blanket copernican albedo botanist data surrounded arose formed test 10 banting km is that wilhelm million surprising seeing friedrich 17861840 johann many poor eastsoutheast drawn 1837 impact ejecta beer julius can patch lro flattened it earthbased condition during showed controversy of 8 experienced see other vanish schmidt had claim for diameter phenomenon ten and believed somewhat from visual perception ha shape inverted interest size made linne mond also small age 1824 linnaeus named original deep western telescope virtually the cone become year serenitatis carl atlas feature high but	lunar crater	lunar crater	Monuments_and_memorials

The garden has been restored and is kept as an 18th-century botanical garden, according to the specifications of Carl Linnaeus, who started studying at Uppsala University in 1730 where he later became professor of botany and principal and is known for formalising the modern system of naming organisms, creating the modern binomial nomenclature, and who owned the garden from 1741 and had it rearranged according to his own ideas, documented in his work <i>Hortus Upsaliensis</i> (1748).</p><p>The garden was originally planned and planted by Olaus Rudbeck, professor of medicine, in 1655, and had about 1,800 different species in late 17th century, but was damaged in the 1702 Uppsala city fire. In 1693, Rudbeck also built the house adjacent to the garden, nowadays known as the <b>Linnaeus Museum</b> (<i><b>Linnémuséet</b></i>), which was residence of Linnaeus from 1743, and from his death in 1778 to 1934 residence of employees at Uppsala University, the last of whom was musician Hugo Alfvén. Since 1937, the house has been a museum of Linnaeus personal and professional life, with furniture, household items and textiles belonging to the Linnaeus family exhibited together with Linnaeus personal medicinal cabinet, insect cabinet and herbarium.</p> <p>After the gardens of Uppsala Castle had been donated to the university by King Gustav III to serve as a new botanical garden, the old one was left to decay. It was bought by the Swedish Linnaean Society in 1917 and restored according to the detailed description in the <i>Hortus Upsaliensis</i>.

High cross	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>A <b>high cross</b> or <b>standing cross</b> (Irish: <i lang=""ga"">cros ard / ardchros</i>, Scottish Gaelic: <i lang=""gd"">crois àrd / àrd-chrois</i>, Welsh: <i lang=""cy"">croes uchel / croes eglwysig</i>) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated. There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain. </p><p>Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork, interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls, all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork. They were probably normally painted, perhaps over a modelled layer of plaster; with the loss of paint and the effects of weathering the reliefs, in particular scenes crowded with small figures, are often now rather indistinct and hard to read. </p><p>The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth. It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high. Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures. The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross; this seems to be an innovation of Celtic Christianity, perhaps at Iona. Although the earliest example of this form has been found on fifth-seventh century Coptic textile. The term ""high cross"" is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations. </p><p>Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as ""preaching crosses"" at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations. They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period. In the 19th century Celtic Revival Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world. Unlike the Irish originals, the decoration usually does not include figures. </p>"	scottish ireland found forming boundary come decorated appear term preceded over or often higher this used essentially stone around first preaching except an coptic typically very seem marked metalwork just freestanding about cro irish by mixture christian in painted section earlier form to gaelic may all they weathering tall be fifthseventh croes monastery sculpted relief example large have variation across gravemarkers crowded anglosaxon these read religious a time which on wa manuscript certainly louth comparison influenced up foot two tallest seven àrd converted century remains monasterboice intersection iona always include decoration usually knotwork indistinct ardchros later crois celtic regional is carving pagan that northumbrian such eight ring could outside christianity doe been gravestone many cross with there raising site ard kingdom probably innovation thick were part standing interlace attachment it plaster not revival medieval became memorial twentytwo some medium crossroad modelled of layer hard developed paint other metre missionary loss textile territory their strong proportion had particular retaining seems location for style popular slender phenomenon early and others from northumbria scotland illuminated moved do whether massive socalled pictish insular now art tradition unclear ha perhaps giving wood single world àrdchrois made richly period erected ornamental also earliest although county small remained date are scene effect using mainly original present three rather area mostly surface surviving unique vinescrolls the than 19th unlike eglwysig outdoors figure stand normally though church uchel high welsh britain at but feature	free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated	made decorated freestanding richly and of christian often cross stone	Monuments_and_memorials

During the mid 19th century, there used to be processions, with pilgrims walking three times around the hill before ascending it to ""listen to the noise"" and leave small sacrifices in a pit at the top. People suffering from headache used to put sand from the pit in their ears. These practices are described by A. A. Panchenko in 1998. The site and the associated folk customs were first described by M. Bystrov in 1879. Bystrov records the tradition that the sand from the hill had miraculous power on Trinity Sunday, and that if the hill was ascended on that day, the sound of bells could be heard if one ""listened in a special way"", and that on this day, pilgrims from as far as 50 miles away would come to the hill in hope of curing headaches.</p> <p>The kurgan has not been excavated, but in 2002 a georadar survey was performed by the Russian Federal Geological Institute (ВСЕГЕИ), and in 2003 to 2004, the Institute for the History of Material Culture of the Russian Academy of Sciences has done experimental surveys testing non-intrusive archaeological methods.

This wealth is evident in the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation. </p><p>Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekt, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them. Certain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in Scythian art.</p><p>""At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons (masks) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Cimmerian Bosporus.""</p>"	found encasing mountain term responsible 4th–3rd over scythian this relative stone plateau bearded permafrost word sitethe scythiantype horseriding hanging 5th certain mask border by completely array in general to geometric may however symbol bce russian household origin isolated example known have large considered preserved variation recur iron these introduction freak hellenistic a time mongolia which one close them bosporus numerous because protective chamber kazakhstan felt century organic doubtless juncture wooden steppe nomad zoomorphic prominently included include russia golden welldefined katanda wider describe burial animal is region ukok when altaisayan novosibirsk great that such boulder trading trapping tomb ice kurgan been wide many bearer spectacular china rare with accumulated site barrowlike kingdom addition were part altai silk south external number it chinese until freeze cairn some furniture india evident of stag covered layer persia merchant type unesco ie other siberia pile mascarons mound their circle into carpet for body outnumbered froze comparable cimmerian and frozen wealth those rosette artat kurgans from good specifically heritage through inspired dated modern pastoral design usage grecoroman neighbouring sun another altaic out world saka excavation motif elaborate earliest shibe containing conserved remained pazyryk city seeped are age buried culture antiquity water decked object than western valley tuekt the climatic substance figure find too notably rarer feature southern at but horse	Iron Age tombs in the Altai Mountains	age tomb mountain altai in iron the	Monuments_and_memorials

Uncovered in 1830, the stone tomb yielded a wealth of precious artifacts which drew considerable public interest to Scythian world. Of particular interest is an intricately granulated earring with two Nike figurines, now in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.[1] </p><p>The tomb was built around 400 to 350 BC, likely by a team of Greek masons from Panticapaeum. Its Plan is almost square, measuring 4.6 by 4.2 meters (15 by 14 ft). The stepped vault stands 5.3 meters (17 ft) high. The timber ceiling seems to have been designed to imitate a Scythian wooden tent; it is decorated by a canopy with gold plaques. </p><p>The body of the king lay by the east wall on a sumptuous wooden couch. His social position was highlighted by a diadem encircling his head, surmounted by a pointed felt headgear with gold pendants. His neck was decorated by a large gold disk weighing 461 grams. Each wrist was adorned with one to three bracelets. A separate section of the couch contained other grave goods, including a phial, a whip, a knife, and a quiver - all inlaid with gold or precious stones. </p><p>To the left of the couch stood a sarcophagus made of cypress wood and ivory. A woman, probably the king's wife or concubine, lay there. Apart from the brocaded dress, her body was decorated with an electrum diadem with large gold pendants, a pair of open-work earrings, a gold disk, a gold necklace, and two gold bracelets. At her side was placed a bronze hand-held mirror with the gilded handle. An electrum cup, placed between her feet, depicts scenes from Scythian mythology (<i>illustrated, to the right</i>). </p><p>The remains of a slave (probably a charioteer) were discovered by the south wall. A special niche in the wall contained horse bones, a helmet, a bronze sheath, and two spearheads. Several silver bowls and bronze cauldrons containing lamb bones were placed along the walls of the tomb. Inside the amphorae were residual traces of dried wine. A number of bronze arrow-heads were scattered around the floor. </p><p>The archaeologists in charge of the dig did not suspect there was a secret room underneath the tomb.

He was born to Bartolomeu Bueno da Ribeira, a Galician settler from Ourense and Maria Pires, from São Paulo, daughter of Salvador Pires and Mécia Fernandes. Amador held several public office posts through royal appointment and elections. </p><p>Since 1580, the Kingdom of Portugal was in a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Spain, up until 1640, when the Portuguese acclaimed John IV of Portugal as the new king. A largely Spanish contingent in São Paulo tried to break away from both in 1641. Without Bueno's consent, they claimed him to be their king. Bueno finally dissuaded the group and urged loyalty to John IV. </p><p>Unrest among the citizens of São Paulo caused that Bueno had to seek sanctuary in the convent of Saint Bento. It is said he tried to reason with the crowds outside the convent from one of the porticos, but they would not return to their homes until the fathers of the convent went out and addressed the multitudes. They would later support the new King of Portugal and keep the unity of the colony of Brazil.

Great Alaska Shootout	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The GCI <b>Great Alaska Shootout</b> (originally known as the <b>Sea Wolf Classic</b>) was an annual college basketball tournament in Anchorage, Alaska that featured colleges from all over the United States. The University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) hosted the tournament every Thanksgiving. Tournament games were played at the Alaska Airlines Center, a new arena on the UAA campus. Prior to the opening of the Alaska Airlines Center in September 2014, games were played at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage. Prior to the Sullivan Arena opening in 1983, games were played at Buckner Fieldhouse. The men's tournament, held annually since 1978, included eight teams while the women's tournament, held annually since 1980, had four participants. </p><p>The tournament was one of the longest-running basketball tournaments, lasting for 39 years, and brought the highest level of basketball to Alaska. The Shootout was held Thanksgiving weekend.</p><p>Under National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules, teams are normally limited to 28 regular-season games. However, games in ""exempted events"", traditionally played early in the season, are not counted against that limit. The most recent policy from the NCAA in this regard allows all teams to play in one exempted event per season. Those teams who choose to take advantage of that opportunity may play up to thirty-one games per season, including games played in those exempted events but excluding postseason tournament games. A previous version of the rule allowed for all games played outside the United States mainland to be exempt from the then-27-game limit. This version was partly responsible for the genesis of tournaments such as Great Alaska Shootout. </p><p>During each of its 40 editions, the Great Alaska Shootout men's tournament field included at least one team that qualified for the NCAA Division I Tournament later that season.

The SuperSonics competed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Western Conference Pacific and Northwest divisions from 1967 until 2008. After the 2007–08 season ended, the team relocated to Oklahoma City, where they now play as the <b>Oklahoma City Thunder</b>. </p><p>Sam Schulman owned the team from its 1967 inception until 1983. It was then owned by Barry Ackerley until 2001, when it came under ownership of the Basketball Club of Seattle, headed by Starbucks chairman emeritus, former president and CEO Howard Schultz. On July 18, 2006, the Basketball Club of Seattle sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise Seattle Storm to the Professional Basketball Club LLC, headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett. The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on October 24, 2006, and finalized seven days later, at which point the new ownership group took control. After failing to find public funding to construct a new arena in the Seattle area, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City before the 2008–09 season, following a $45 million settlement with the city of Seattle to pay off their existing lease at the KeyArena at Seattle Center in advance of its 2010 expiration.</p><p>Home games were played at the KeyArena (originally the Seattle Center Coliseum) for 33 of the franchise's 41 seasons in Seattle. In 1978, the team moved to the Kingdome, which they shared with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). They returned to the Coliseum in 1985, moving temporarily to the Tacoma Dome for the 1994–95 season while the Coliseum was renovated and renamed the KeyArena. </p><p>The SuperSonics won the NBA championship in 1979. Overall, the franchise won three Western Conference titles (1978, 1979 and 1996) and six divisional titles (their last being in 2005), with five in the Pacific Division and one in the Northwest Division. Settlement terms of a lawsuit between the city of Seattle and Clay Bennett's ownership group stipulated the SuperSonics' banners, trophies and retired jerseys remain in Seattle; the nickname, logo, and color scheme are available to any subsequent NBA team that plays at a renovated KeyArena subject to NBA approval.

Seattle Reign (basketball)	"<p>The <b>Seattle Reign</b> was the first women's professional basketball franchise in Seattle, Washington, USA. The Reign was a charter member of the American Basketball League (ABL). The team played from 1996 through 1998. The team's name was a reference to the city's reputation for rain and its location in King County, with an additional allusion to ""The Reign Man"" Shawn Kemp, then the city's biggest basketball star. </p><p>The Reign played most of its home games in the Mercer Arena, part of Seattle Center, but occasionally the team played at the larger KeyArena, home of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. The Arena was an old-fashioned, intimate setting for a basketball game, but its seating capacity of about 5,000 limited the team's upside attendance potential. </p><p>In the team's inaugural season, the Reign drafted 1996 Olympic team veteran Venus Lacy to play center, but Lacy was generally outshone by the team's other two ""big women"", Cindy Brown and Tari Phillips. (This was the case even before February 4, 1997, when Lacy was lost for the season due to a severe car injury.) The starting point guard for most games was Christy Hedgpeth, and Kate Paye was the shooting guard. Another player of note was Angela Aycock. </p><p>In the team's second season, with some fanfare, the team drafted Stanford small forward Kate Starbird, who had been a local prep star at Tacoma's Lakes High School. An even bigger impact player proved to be the University of Alabama's Shalonda Enis, who was named the ABL's Rookie of the Year for the 1997–98 season. </p><p>From 1997 on, the ABL faced serious competition from the deeper-pocketed WNBA. Fifteen games into the Reign's third season, on December 22, 1998 the ABL suddenly reached a financial crisis and folded its operations. The Reign was in the midst of its only winning season, and had only weeks before scored their most memorable victory, a double-overtime win before an enthusiastic crowd of 7,400 at the KeyArena, over the San Jose Lasers, led by Jennifer Azzi.</p><p>Unlike most localities that had an ABL team, Seattle was quickly awarded a WNBA franchise two years later.

List of Birmingham City F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Birmingham City Football Club, an association football club based in Birmingham, England, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For the first thirteen years of their existence, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. Small Heath first entered the FA Cup in the 1881–82 season, and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.</p><p>In 1888, the club became a limited company under the name of Small Heath F.C. Ltd, and joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. However, the Combination was not well organised and folded in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding. Small Heath were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889–90, and three years later were elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. They topped the table in their first season, failing to win promotion via the test match system then in operation, but reached the top flight for the first time in 1894. They were renamed Birmingham in 1905, finally becoming Birmingham City in 1943.</p><p>The club's official history rated 1955–56 as their best season to date. The newly promoted club achieved their highest ever finishing position of sixth in the First Division, reached the 1956 FA Cup Final, and became the first English club side to participate in European competition when they played their opening game in the group stages of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Their only major trophy is the League Cup, which they won in 1963 and 2011; they reached the FA Cup final twice and the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup twice. During the 1990s, they twice won the Associate Members' Cup, a competition open to clubs in the third and fourth tiers of English football. </p><p>As of the end of the 2021–22 season, the club's first team had spent 57 seasons in the top division of English football, 58 in the second, and 4 in the third.

List of Darlington F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Darlington Football Club, an English association football club based in Darlington, County Durham, was founded in 1883. In their second season, they won the major regional trophy, the Durham Challenge Cup, and the following season they entered the FA Cup for the first time, only to lose 8–0 to Grimsby Town. In 1889, Darlington were one of the founder members of the Northern League; they won the league title in 1896 and 1900, and reached the semi-final of the FA Amateur Cup in the same two seasons. The club turned professional in 1908 and joined the North-Eastern League. The 1910–11 season saw Darlington reach the last 16 of the FA Cup, progressing through five qualifying rounds to lose to Swindon Town in the third round proper. They won the North-Eastern League in 1913 and 1921, and were invited to join the newly formed Football League Third Division North.</p><p>Runners-up in their first season in the Football League, Darlington were Third Division North champions three years later, thus winning promotion to the Second Division. Their 15th-place finish in 1926 remains, as of 2021, their best League performance; they were relegated back to the Third Division in 1927, where they remained until the Second World War put an end to competitive football. They came third in 1929–30, but twice had to apply for re-election to the League, in 1932–33 and 1936–37, after finishing in last place in the section. In 1934, they enjoyed their first success in a nationally organised cup competition, defeating Stockport County 4–3 at Old Trafford to win the Football League Third Division North Cup, and reached the final again two years later. In the 1957–58 season, the club equalled their previous best FA Cup run, reaching the last 16 by defeating Chelsea, Football League champions only three years earlier, in the fourth round. When the regional sections of the Third Division were merged in 1958–59 to form two national divisions, Darlington were placed in the fourth tier.</p><p>Darlington won promotion to the Third Division in 1965–66, but for one season only. Their most successful season in the League Cup came in 1967–68: drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County in the quarter-final, they took the lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for re-election to the League five times. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division in the 1980s; their 13th-place finish in 1986 was a record high since the introduction of the four-division structure. Darlington were relegated from the Football League in 1988–89 after 68 years of continuous membership. They made an immediate return as Conference champions, then won the Fourth Division title in 1990–91, but spent only one season in the third tier before relegation followed.</p><p>Darlington lost in both the second and the third rounds of the 1999–2000 FA Cup. Manchester United's decision to play in the FIFA Club World Championship rather than the FA Cup left a space in the third round which the organisers filled by drawing lots from among the 20 teams eliminated in the second. Darlington were the ""lucky losers"", and were beaten 2–1 by Aston Villa in the third round after losing 3–1 to Gillingham in the second. They came close to a return to the Third Division via the play-offs in 1996 and 2000, and a period of administration in 2008–09 resulted in a 10-point deduction, without which they would again have reached the play-offs. The following season they were relegated to the Conference for the second time, and went on to reach the 2011 FA Trophy Final, in which Chris Senior scored the only goal of the game in the last minute of extra time to defeat Mansfield Town.</p><p>In 2011–12, another period of administration forced the termination of players' contracts before a last-minute injection of funding enabled Darlington to complete the season. The new owners' failure to secure a Company Voluntary Arrangement before exiting administration meant the Football Association treated the club as a new club, placed it in the Northern League, required a change of playing name – Darlington 1883 was chosen – and barred it from entry to national competitions. The new club won the 2012–13 Northern League title by a 13-point margin to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North for 2013–14, followed two years later by consecutive promotions: first to the Premier Division via the play-offs, then to the National League North as 2015–16 Northern Premier League champions. They were unable to make it three in a row when, despite finishing in the playoff positions in 2016–17, ground grading issues prevented their participation.</p><p>The table details their achievements in senior first-team competitions from their first appearance in the FA Cup in 1885–86 to the end of the most recently completed season. </p>"	association consecutive 1910–11 war joined grading 13thplace champion defeating play voluntary row finishing north season first an finish 2011–12 lucky town club after appearance competitive only put conference 1885–86 gain 1990–91 left 1927 came scored by entry 2012–13 make in aston section to earlier form 1934 they exiting 1936–37 space northeastern goal entered equalled lost enjoyed professional 1986 have membership before join introduction chosen margin time a 1921 major one invited stockport tierdarlington wa 1965–66 third most spent which followeddarlington close failure playing ground team 16 2011 two 15thplace funding league change successful tier 2021 manchester deduction completed where remains old formed success both senior firstteam won 20 2000 drawing new round lose grimsby fourth semifinal final same later reach regional promotion structure title immediate without when 1908 beaten 1913 cup player achievement swindon game 8–0 apply english proper minute defeat required again among losing barred saw name durham qualifying drawn football issue return relegated mansfield win forced performance were since reaching brian 1932–33 record it 1929–30 lot villa during following until thus termination darlington premier 1958–59 1926 of 1883 administration 4–3 derby prevented owner founded twice previous 3–1 via complete – unable cloughs 2016–17 division their trafford 2–1 merged 68 uniteds fifa had injection townin continuous playoff newly secure trophy for based founder progressing end competition 1980s took 2013–14 and loser 1999–2000 challenge run 1900 from on enabled 13point 2008–09 through treated gillingham would fa place second organised 10point last national 1970s fourdivision organiser another northrunnersup reelection table best member back company world went made period placed contract reached eliminated relegation 5–4 county remained then participationthe quarterfinal lead 2015–16 extra filled turned 1967–68 chelsea 1957–58 1988–89 chris lastminute 1889 three 1896 rather followed despite position amateur than the winning year detail nationally meant resulted recently away northern championship 1996 decision five high arrangement at but	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Sports_teams

List of Portsmouth F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>This is a list of seasons played by Portsmouth Football Club in English and European football, from 1899 (the year of the club's first FA Cup entry and elected straight into the first division of the Southern League) to the most recent completed season. Football was played in the city of Portsmouth from the 1850s and was popular for sailors and dockers to play in the city. The current club was founded in 1898 with John Brickwood, owner of the local brewery, as chairman, and Frank Brettell as the club's first manager. </p><p>A common myth is that the club's first goalkeeper was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. While Conan Doyle did play as <i>AC Smith</i> for an amateur side, Portsmouth Athletic Football Club, that flourished from 1882 to 1894, the first goalkeeper of the professional era was Matt Reilly who previously played for the successful Royal Artillery team. </p><p>Portsmouth was formed to replace the defunct Royal Artillery Portsmouth club, and elected straight into the first division of the Southern League. The club's first league match was played at Chatham Town on 2 September 1899 (a 1–0 victory), followed three days later by the first match at Fratton Park against local rivals Southampton. That first season was hugely successful, with the club winning 20 out of 28 league matches, earning them runners-up spot in the Southern League. The league was won for the first time in the 1901–02 season, by which time Brettell had been replaced by club captain Bob Blyth as manager. </p><p>The 1906–07 season was highlighted by the visit of Manchester United to Fratton Park in the FA Cup, which generated a record attendance of 24,329. A 2–2 draw meant a replay in Manchester, and Portsmouth recorded a famous 2–1 win. However, this record attendance was surpassed two seasons later when Sheffield Wednesday visited Fratton for the second round of the new FA Cup. </p><p>1910–11 saw Portsmouth relegated, but with the recruitment of Robert Brown as manager the team were promoted the next season. </p><p>The club has won the League Championship twice, the FA Cup twice, never won the League Cup, the Charity Shield once (shared). </p><p>This list details the club's achievements in all major competitions, and the top scorers for each season. Top scorers in <b>bold</b> were also the top scorers in the English league that season.

""The U's"" reached the top tier of English football in 1985 after successive promotions, where they stayed for 3 years. During this time United won their only piece of major silverware, the 1986 Football League Cup. </p><p>Apart from relegation to the redesignated Second Division (the old Third Division after the creation of the Premier League) and subsequent promotion shortly afterwards, Oxford United remained in the second tier for eleven years until 1999. After this a decline set in, with two relegations in three years to the Football League Third Division, the fourth tier of English football. In 2006 Oxford became the first club to have reached the First Division and won a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. One of the teams to be promoted were Conference champions Accrington Stanley, 44 years after Accrington lost their league status to Oxford.

List of Port Vale F.C. seasons	"<p> Port Vale Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, playing in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. After becoming one of the more prominent football clubs in Staffordshire, Burslem Port Vale were invited to become founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892. They spent 13 non-consecutive seasons in the division, punctuated by two seasons in the Midland League, before they resigned due to financial difficulties and entered liquidation in 1907. The name of Port Vale continued in the North Staffordshire Federation League, and this new club were successful enough to be reinstated into the Football League in October 1919. They spent 16 non-consecutive seasons in the Second Division, punctuated by them winning the Third Division North title in 1929–30, before dropping back into the third tier for a much longer stay at the end of the 1935–36 campaign. The 1953–54 season saw manager Freddie Steele's ""Iron Curtain"" defence win both a Third Division North title and a semi-final place in the FA Cup. They failed to build on this success however, though went on to finish as champions of the first ever Fourth Division season under Norman Low's stewardship in 1958–59. </p><p>The club had little success throughout the 1960s and 1970s, despite being briefly managed by Stanley Matthews, and in fact were forced to apply for re-election after breaking FA rules on illegal payments in 1968. Gordon Lee guided the club to promotion back to the Third Division the following season, where they would remain until relegation at the end of the 1977–78 campaign. John McGrath steered the club to promotion in 1982–83, though he departed after relegation became inevitable the following season. His assistant, John Rudge, stepped up to become the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, leading the club from 1983 to 1999. Under his leadership Port Vale won promotions in 1985–86, 1988–89 and 1993–94, lifted the League Trophy in 1993 and reached a post-war record finish of eighth in the second tier in the 1996–97 season. After Rudge's reign ended the club entered a decline, slipping into the fourth tier whilst twice entering administration in 2003 and 2012. The decline was arrested when Norman Smurthwaite brought the club out of administration in 2012 and manager Micky Adams achieved automatic promotion from League Two in the 2012–13 season, though they were relegated back into League Two at the end of the 2016–17 season after a failed experiment with a continental staff and playing style. </p><p>First team matches were recorded for the first time in 1882, meaning records go back over 125 years, friendlies are not included in this data (including goal tallies). As of the 2021–22 season, Port Vale have never played top-flight football, they have spent 41 seasons in the second tier, 46 seasons in the third tier, 23 seasons in the fourth tier of the Football League, as well as 16 seasons in non-League football.

List of Bury F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Bury Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Bury, which was in Lancashire until 1974 when it was absorbed into Greater Manchester. Founded in 1885, Bury first entered the FA Cup in 1887–88. Drawn to play Blackburn Rovers away from home, they travelled to Ewood Park but scratched before the game; the two teams played a friendly match instead, which Bury lost heavily. The team first contested an FA Cup match in 1891–92: they beat Witton and Heywood Central before losing to Blackpool after a replay in the third qualifying round.</p><p>Bury were founder members of and runners-up in the Lancashire League in 1889–90, and won the championship in their second and third seasons. They were elected to the Football League ahead of the 1893–94 season, won the Second Division title that same season by a nine-point margin, and beat Liverpool, the First Division's bottom club, in the test match to gain promotion. They retained their top-flight status for 17 seasons. During that period Bury twice won the FA Cup. In the 1900 final, they beat Southern League team Southampton by four goals to nil. Three years later, they did not concede a goal in any round as they went on to beat Derby County 6–0, which remains the widest winning margin in an FA Cup final; the ball used in that match is on display at the National Football Museum.</p><p>They returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in the mid-1920s, and achieved their highest ever finish, of fourth place, in 1925–26. Relegated back to the Second in 1929, Bury did not play in the top flight again; the closest they came was a third place in 1936–37. They flirted with relegation all through the 1950s, finally dropping into the Third Division North for the first time in the club's history in that league's last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958. Returning to the Second Division as Third Division champions in 1961, Bury spent seven of the next eight seasons at that level. In 1962–63, they reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup, losing 4–3 on aggregate to eventual winners Birmingham City. By 1971 Bury were in the Fourth Division, only for a three-season spell, but they were to spend the first half of the 1980s at that level.</p><p>Further spells in the third and fourth tiers preceded two successive promotions in the mid-1990s: third place in Division Three – after the Premier League broke away from the Football League in 1992, the divisions were renumbered upwards – followed by the Division Two title in 1996–97 brought Bury to the second tier for the first time in forty years. After two seasons they were relegated, and by 2002, financial problems brought the club into administration and to the brink of folding. A supporters' campaign raised enough money to keep the club afloat, and in recognition of his role within that process, UEFA presented club press officer Gordon Sorfleet with their Best Supporter award for 2002. Bury were relegated at the end of that season, and then yo-yoed between the third and fourth tiers. Promoted to League One in 2019 against a background of increasingly damaging financial and ownership issues, Bury's early fixtures in the 2019–20 season were successively postponed until, on 27 August 2019, after 125 years continuous membership, the club was expelled from the Football League.</p><p>Bury spent 22 seasons in the top tier of the English football league system, 39 in the second, 29 in the third and 24 in the fourth.

List of Chesterfield F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Chesterfield Football Club is an English association football club based in the Derbyshire town of Chesterfield. The current club dates from 1919, but the histories of earlier Chesterfield-based clubs are generally discussed alongside that of the current club. The first Chesterfield F.C. was founded in the mid-1860s and survived until 1881, long before league football existed. The second incarnation, which became known as Chesterfield Town F.C., was formed in 1884. Its first team joined and won the Sheffield &amp; District League in 1891–92, and first entered the FA Cup the following season. Drawn away to Gainsborough Trinity in the first qualifying round, the score stood at 2–2 at full time; Trinity scored twice during extra time, but darkness fell before the agreed half hour was complete, so the match was ordered to be replayed. Chesterfield lost the replay 4–0. They continued in the Sheffield leagues until joining the Midland Football League in 1896. After three top-four finishes, Chesterfield were elected to the Second Division of the Football League for the 1899–1900 season. The team generally struggled in the Football League: they placed fifth in 1904–05, but followed up with four consecutive bottom-three positions. Three times they successfully applied for re-election to the League, but the fourth application failed, and Chesterfield returned to the Midland League in 1909. Despite winning the title that season, they were not accepted back into the Football League, and continued in the Midland League until competitive football was suspended for the duration of the First World War.</p><p>Chesterfield Town went into voluntary liquidation in 1915. A third club, formed to participate in the wartime competitions, failed because of financial irregularities, and when competitive football resumed, Chesterfield Council founded its own club, Chesterfield Municipal. They won the first post-war Midland League title – and were expelled from that season's FA Cup for fielding an ineligible player – but when the football authorities made clear their opposition to municipal ownership of clubs, the council's involvement ceased and the club was renamed Chesterfield F.C. It was a founder member of the Football League Third Division North, spent much of the 1920s in the top half of that division, and won the title in 1930–31. They retained their Second Division status for just two seasons, won a further Third Division North championship in 1936, and remained in the second tier until the interruption for war and for five seasons thereafter. Consistent top-half finishes meant Chesterfield were allocated to the Third Division when the regional sections were amalgamated into Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958, but they lasted only three seasons before making their debut at the lower level.</p><p>Chesterfield were promoted as 1969–70 Fourth Division champions. In 1980–81, they entered and won the last edition of the Anglo-Scottish Cup, defeating Scottish giants Rangers 3–0 in the quarter-finals before beating Notts County in the final. Two years later, they were relegated, and came close to folding, with debts of £400,000 and only seven contracted professionals, before bouncing back to win their second Fourth Division title in 1985. Over the next 30 years, they experienced four relegations and four promotions between third and fourth tiers. Promoted via the play-offs in 1995, they came within a point of the play-offs the following season, and reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1996–97, in which they faced Middlesbrough of the Premier League. With 21 minutes left and Chesterfield leading 2–1, Jonathan Howard shot against the underside of the bar; the ball bounced down and then out, and referee David Elleray ruled, incorrectly, that it had not crossed the line. A minute later, he awarded a penalty to Middlesbrough for a foul that took place outside the penalty area. Middlesbrough scored, and took a 3–2 lead in extra time, but Jamie Hewitt equalised with seconds left. Chesterfield lost the replay 3–0.</p><p>In 2000–01, a nine-point deduction for financial irregularities, initially deemed too lenient by the Football League, failed to prevent Chesterfield's automatic promotion in third place, and the following year the club was taken out of administration into the ownership and control of the Chesterfield Football Supporters' Society. In the second round of the 2008–09 FA Cup, Chesterfield lost to non-league club Droylsden, but were awarded the tie when their opponents were found to have fielded an ineligible player; when Chesterfield did the same in 2014–15, they were only required to replay the tie, and won. They again won the fourth-tier title in 2010–11 and the following season won the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams from the two lower divisions of the Football League, beating Swindon Town 2–0 in the final. Chesterfield won the fourth-tier championship for a league record fourth time in 2013–14, and again reached the Football League Trophy final; this time they lost 3–1 to Peterborough United. Two consecutive bottom-of-the-table finishes took them back to non-league football in 2018.</p><p>Since their first admission to the Football League in 1899, Chesterfield have spent 20 seasons in the second tier of the English football league system, 55 in the third, 25 in the fourth and 11 in non-league football. The table details the team's achievements and the top goalscorer in senior first-team competitions from their first season in the Sheffield &amp; District League in 1891–92 to the end of the most recently completed season. </p>"	joined wartime over authority 3–0 system 1936 bounced after competitive fifth deemed left society hewitt topfour a 1891–92 most third up jonathan further droylsden completed resumed firstteam won foul fourth 1899 taken same regional title that 21 successfully again ranger stood qualifying 1980–81 it 2–2 premier giant of administration own much experienced via ruled division control into discussed despite shot based took incorrectly council duration from tie liquidation last 1995 table made top admission 3–2 clear date lead three 1896 too championship expelled 1958 bar seven first season finish 2010–11 returned town club he angloscottish just came scored by in section penalty they opposition 2–0 entered have professional 2000–01 before close equalised team chesterfield two league leading 55 round history 1985 1881 promoted achievement english sheffield 1899–1900 consistent football win record not applied full during peterborough 3–0in founded 3–1 financial point 2–1 had tophalf for and between fa ownership 1919 amp member accepted retained out went darkness placed gainsborough allocated then middlesbrough position initially area thereafter joining amalgamated interruption ball consecutive 1909 suspended this line voluntary did against existed district underside only united renamed bouncing to be lenient fielded 1884 replayed participate debt fourthtier lasted 1930–31 ninepoint time spent 1915 because 2014–15 4–0 tier deduction agreed final later semifinal contracted is mid1860s when player outside drawn relegated were fc following jamie twice ceased failed 1904–05 application warchesterfield 30 alongside trophy competition incarnation 2008–09 hour place second municipal so postwar within match half involvement bottomthree reelection back automatic chesterfieldbased folding debut reached faced relegation county remained quarterfinal elleray elected the year detail meant opponent at but association scottish found war champion defeating continued north generally an bottomofthetable four survived ordered trinity making earlier £400000 known lost levelchesterfield 1920s ineligible crossed down fell which wa them 25 next 1996–97 formed irregularity senior 20 promotion howard cup swindon fielding minute required goalscorer with derbyshire became until supporter score complete – open long their 11 playoff founder 2013–14 end beating 2018since 1969–70 awarded referee midland nonleague world lower current replay are extra followed status winning notts recently prevent away david five struggled edition	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Sports_teams
List of Crawley Town F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Crawley Town Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Crawley, West Sussex. Founded in 1896 as Crawley F.C., the team played in junior leagues until 1951 when they were admitted to the Sussex County League as part of its attempted expansion. In their second season, they finished bottom of that league's First Division with only 4 points from 26 matches, but regulations prevented any team being relegated until the division reached its full complement of 16 teams. After another last-place finish two seasons later, they were relegated, but a runners-up spot in the Second Division in 1955–56 preceded a move into the Metropolitan &amp; District League.</p><p>In 1958, under its new name of Crawley Town, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time; its team lost in the preliminary round at home to Horsham. It adopted professional status four years later, and entered the Southern League in 1963–64. Crawley gained promotion to that league's Premier Division for the 1969–70 season, but dropped straight back to Division One. When the league expanded to create two regional second-tier divisions, Crawley were placed in the southern division. They remained in the southern half when the creation of the Alliance Premier League as the top non-league division forced another restructure of the Southern League, this time with parallel Midland and Southern Divisions. Crawley's lowly finish in 1981–82 meant they failed to benefit from yet another reorganisation, whereby the top ten teams in each regional division formed a new Premier Division, but two years later they were promoted as runners-up.</p><p>They remained at that level for the next twenty years, until they won their first Southern League title in 2003–04 and consequent promotion to the new Conference National. Despite a variety of points deductions, including ten points in 2006–07 for entering administration and six the following season for financial irregularities, and a transfer embargo, they held on to their Conference status. In 2010–11, they not only progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup, coming ""within inches"" of drawing with Manchester United at Old Trafford via Richard Brodie's header against the crossbar, they were not distracted from the league campaign; a 30-match unbeaten run and a Conference record 105 points earned them the 2010–11 title and promotion to the Football League. As well as reaching the FA Cup fifth round again, they came third in their first season in League Two, so went up to League One, where they remained for three seasons before returning to the fourth tier.</p><p>The table details the team's achievements and the top goalscorer in senior first-team competitions from their first season in the Sussex County League in 1951–52 to the end of the most recently completed season. </p>"	association preceded variety spot 2003–04 this consequent crossbar season first 4 an finish alliance 2010–11 against four district town club after distracted only conference entering fifth home united came in admitted to they create entered lost professional transfer lastplace before 1951–52 held any a time one on most them third junior up team sussex 16 horsham two next header league coming deduction manchester completed secondtier where metropolitan six old formed restructure irregularity senior whereby won firstteam drawing new round fourth later being promotion regional is lowly benefit when each promoted title cup 105 achievement that english earned again richard tierthe goalscorer complement name parallel with crawleys football relegated 1955–56 forced adopted were part expanded preliminary fc reaching straight record it 2006–07 not full returning creation until following reorganisation premier 30match dropped of administration prevented founded campaign failed via financial point division expansion their trafford into including despite for based competition end twenty and ten under run from 1951 leaguein regulation progressed fa 1969–70 second 26 midland so nonleague played within national match half another amp table back went placed 1981–82 top reached runnersup gained unbeaten 1963–64 inch yet attempted county remained west status three 1896 brodies crawley move level the bottom year detail meant recently 1958 well runnersupthey southern at but finished embargo	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Sports_teams
List of Hartlepool United F.C. seasons	<p> Hartlepool United Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Hartlepool, County Durham. The club was founded in 1908, and its first team played in the North-Eastern League from then until 1921, when the Football League formed a new Third Division based in the north of England. Hartlepool have never played above the third tier of English football, nor have they won a divisional title, but they remained a member of the Football League for 89 consecutive seasons before returning to non-league football in 2017. They hold the record for applications for re-election, with fourteen – three to the Third Division North and a divisional record eleven to the Fourth Division – and all fourteen were successful. Their highest league placing was second in the Third Division North in 1956–57 – only the champions were promoted – but a year later, they were placed in the Fourth Division when the regionalised third tiers were merged into nationwide third and fourth tiers. Since that restructure, their highest league finish has been sixth in the third tier, in 2003–04 and 2004–05; on the latter occasion, they reached the play-off final but lost out to Sheffield Wednesday. They were relegated from the Football League for the first time in 2016–17. They reached the last 32 of the FA Cup for the first time in 1954–55, and have matched that performance six times since, most recently in 2021–22. In the Football League Cup, their best performance was to reach the last 16 in 1975–76. </p>	association never consecutive 2003–04 champion hartlepool north first season an finish town 2017 club only united nationwide in 32 to all they northeastern divisional occasion have lost before hold a time 1921 on most wa england third placing team fourteen 16 above wednesday league tier successful six formed 89 restructure won new fourth final later reach promoted is title when 1908 cup that english sheffield been 1954–55 durham with football eleven relegated nor performance were since record it returning until 2004–05 1956–57 2021–22 of founded – 2016–17 application division their into merged sixth matched playoff for based and 1975–76 from fa second highest nonleague played last ha reelection best member out placed reached county then remained regionalised latter three the year recently but	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Sports_teams
List of Mansfield Town F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Mansfield Town Football Club is an English association football club based in the Nottinghamshire town of Mansfield. Founded in 1897 as Mansfield Wesleyans, the team first entered the Mansfield &amp; District Amateur League in 1902. Four years later, the club turned professional, tweaked its name to Mansfield Wesley, and joined the Notts &amp; District League. The team made their debut in the FA Cup in 1909–10, and joined the Central Alliance in 1911, by which time the club had adopted its current name of Mansfield Town. In the first post-First World War season, they moved to the Field Mill ground and won the Central Alliance title, and in 1921, they were accepted into the Midland League. Three years later, they won the Midland League title, repeated the feat the following year, and were runners-up the next. Applications for election to the Football League were unsuccessful, but in the hope of a better class of football, they had one season in the Midland Combination, primarily a reserve league for Football League clubs, before returning to the Midland League. In 1928–29, Mansfield won the Midland League title by a nine-point margin and beat two Football League clubs on the way to their first appearance in the fourth round of the FA Cup, in which they lost 2–0 to Arsenal at Highbury.</p><p>Geographically, Mansfield lay on the border between the catchment areas of the Northern and Southern sections of the regionalised Third Division of the League. They had previously applied for election to the Northern Section; for the 1931–32 season, they applied to the Southern Section, and were admitted. After one season, in which they struggled, the team was reallocated to the Northern Section, before returning to the Southern in 1937. Competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Mansfield finished 22nd and bottom in the first post-war season, and thus had to apply for re-election to the League. The management committee decided that in light of the difficult circumstances facing all clubs in resuming competitive professional football after the war, all clubs facing re-election should be accepted unopposed. Mansfield were transferred to the Northern Section for 1947–48. Three seasons later, they finished runners-up – at that time, only the champions were promoted – and reached the fifth round (last 16) of the FA Cup for the first time, losing to First Division team and eventual cup finalists Blackpool. Against a background of financial and governance problems that brought the club close to bankruptcy, Mansfield remained in the Northern Section until the regional sections were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions in 1958, when they were placed in the Third Division.</p><p>Two years later, Mansfield were relegated for the first time in their history. In their third season in the fourth tier, they finished fourth and were promoted on goal average, ahead of Gillingham by 0.118 of a goal. After a further nine years in the Third – during which time they reached the 1968–69 FA Cup quarter-final, which remains their best achievement in the competition – and three in the Fourth Divisions, Mansfield won their first title at Football League level, taking the 1974–75 Fourth Division by a six-point margin. A season of consolidation, whose highlights included progressing to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the first of two Anglo-Scottish Cup semi-finals, preceded another championship: the 1976–77 Third Division title gained Mansfield promotion to the Football League Second Division for the first and as yet only time. They could not maintain that status, and for the next thirty years continued to drift between third and fourth tiers, during which time they won the 1986–87 Associate Members' Cup, a cup competition open to teams from the lowest two tiers of the League; Mansfield beat Bristol City in a penalty shoot-out in the final. In 2007–08, they finished 23rd in the fourth tier and were relegated out of the Football League into the Conference National (promotion and relegation between League and Conference had replaced re-election in 1987). They reached the final of the 2010–11 FA Trophy, losing to Darlington in the last minute of extra time, before returning to the League as Conference champions in 2013.</p><p>Since their admission to the Football League, Mansfield Town have spent 1 season in the second tier of the English football league system, 42 in the third, 35 in the fourth, and 5 in the top tier of non-league football.

List of Peterborough United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Peterborough United Football Club is an English association football club based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. After former Southern League club Peterborough &amp; Fletton United folded in 1932, there had been no senior football in the Peterborough area. In the summer of 1934, a new professional club, named Peterborough United, was founded to take its place. It was welcomed into membership of the Midland League for 1934–35, and the club's first team finished that initial season in mid-table. They entered the national cup competition, the FA Cup, the following season, but lost their opening match 3–0 at home to Rushden Town in the first qualifying round. When competitive football resumed after the Second World War, Peterborough enjoyed improved performances in both league and cup competition. In the cup, they regularly reached the rounds proper, and progressed to the fourth round in 1956–57 and 1959–60, eliminating two Football League teams on the first occasion and three on the second. In the Midland League, they finished second in 1953–54, third the following year, and then embarked on a run of five consecutive championships, scoring more than 100 goals in each campaign. Repeated attempts at election to the Football League failed – albeit narrowly in 1958–59 – until they finally gained admission to the Fourth Division in 1960 at the expense of Gateshead.</p><p>Their momentum continued into the new Football League season: in second place with Christmas approaching, Peterborough did not lose again until the following April. They won the Fourth Division title, scoring what remains a Football League record 134 goals. Terry Bly supplied 52 of those 134 – not a league record, but a seasonal total which has not been surpassed since. They followed up with four top-half finishes at the higher level before dropping to mid-table, eliminated Arsenal among others on their way to the sixth round (quarter-final) of the 1964–65 FA Cup, and went one step further in the 1965–66 League Cup, losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semifinal, but problems off the field disrupted their further progress. In November 1967, the Football Association and Football League met to consider charges of making illegal payments to players, poor accounting practices and poor internal governance, stemming from claims surrounding an FA Cup match against Sunderland the previous January. They decided that Peterborough would be demoted to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1967–68 season. At the time, they stood fourth in the Third Division after 19 matches. They won their second Fourth Division championship in 1973–74, this time spending five years in the Third before returning to the fourth tier until 1991.</p><p>Back-to-back promotions – via a fourth-place finish in 1990–91 and the play-offs in 1992, beating Stockport County 2–1 in the final, – earned Peterborough a place in the second tier for the first time in the club's history. They came 10th in what was called the First Division – when the newly formed FA Premier League split from the Football League, the remaining divisions of the Football League were renumbered upwards – which remains the team's highest league finish. and were relegated in 1993–94. They returned to the second tier, which by then had been rebranded as the Football League Championship, in 2009, again after two consecutive promotions. Although relegated straight back to League One, they were immediately re-promoted, and stayed up for two seasons.

List of Scunthorpe United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Scunthorpe United Football Club, an English association football club based in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was founded in 1899 as the result of a merger between Brumby Hall F.C. and another club. The team first entered the national cup competition, the FA Cup, in 1909–10; they beat Withernsea 8–0 in the preliminary round before losing 4–0 to York City in the first qualifying round. In 1910, after amalgamating with North Lindsey United, the club took the name Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United, and two years later, it became a member of the Midland League. The first team finished that initial season in the lower reaches of the table, but when competitive football resumed after the First World War, they enjoyed consecutive top-seven finishes, culminating in their first Midland League title in 1926–27, a success fuelled by 52 goals from former England international Ernie Simms. They again won the title in 1938–39, and it seemed for much of the season as if Harry Johnson was sure to overtake Simms' total, but he missed several matches in the later part of the season and had to settle for 49.</p><p>Scunthorpe made their first application to join the Football League ahead of the formation of the Northern Section of the Third Division in 1921; they were not elected, and their bids for election continued to fail until the League's next expansion, in 1950. The voting was tight, but Scunthorpe became one of two Midland League teams to join the Northern Section when each regional third-tier division grew from 22 to 24. They finished the 1950–51 Football League season in mid-table, and seven years later won the Third Division North title – the last season of that league before the regional divisions were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions – by a seven-point margin. They also reached the fifth round (last 16) of the FA Cup for the first time, defeating First Division club Newcastle United and holding Liverpool for 75 minutes before conceding the only goal of the match.</p><p>Ahead of their Second Division debut, the club dropped the Lindsey from its name, becoming plain Scunthorpe United. They spent six seasons at that level, and finished a club record fourth in 1961–62, five points behind the second promotion place. After four seasons in the Third Division, they dropped to the Fourth, in which they remained for the next 36 years, apart from three single-season ventures into the higher level; the last of those, in 1999–2000, came courtesy of their fifth attempt at promotion via the play-offs. The Football League rebranded their divisions ahead of the 2004–05 season, so that the fourth tier became Football League Two, and the change of name coincided with a change of fortune for Scunthorpe. Gaining promotion to League One as runners-up, ahead of Swansea City on goal difference, this time they not only stayed up but went on to win the League One title in 2006–07. Relegated in their first season in the Championship, they came straight back via the play-offs to spend another two seasons in the second tier. In 2008–09, they lost to Luton Town in the final of the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams from the third and fourth tiers of the English football league system, and the following season, they reached the last 16 of the League Cup for the first time. Two relegations in three years returned them to the fourth tier, from which they bounced straight back as 2013–14 runners-up. After twice reaching the play-offs, they were relegated to League Two in 2019. </p><p>As of the end of the 2020–21 season, the team have spent 37 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 25 in the third, and 9 in the second.

List of Southend United F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p> Southend United Football Club, an English association football club based in Southend, Essex, was founded in 1906. The club's first team won the Southern League Second Division championship in their first season. Southend had to apply for election alongside the two bottom First Division teams who were applying for re-election; they were unsuccessful. Southend won the title again the following year, and this time, with more places available after two clubs had joined the Football League, they were elected. By 1910–11, the Southern League had adopted automatic promotion and relegation, and Southend were relegated. They returned to the top tier as runners-up in 1912–13, and remained at that level until 1920, when the Football League added a Third Division made up almost entirely of the Southern League First Division teams. That same season, Southend reached the third round (last 16) of the FA Cup; they have progressed to the last 16 four times since, but have gone no further.</p><p>Southend remained in the Third Division for the next 39 seasons. The closest they came to a change were via two successful application for re-election, in 1921–22, their second season as a Football League club, and then in 1934–35, and two third-place finishes, in 1931–32 and 1949–50, at a time when only the divisional champions were promoted. In 1965–66, they were relegated to the Fourth Division, and spent the next 25 years oscillating between the two. Southend's first trophy in the Football League came in 1980–81, courtesy of a strong defence and a particularly strong home record, as they won the Fourth Division title by a two-point margin. Eight years later, they were again promoted from the fourth tier, this time in third place, and the following season, a final-day defeat deprived Southend of the title but they were still sure of the runners-up spot that gained promotion to the second tier for the first time in the club's history. Southend spent six seasons at the higher level, during which time they lost a penalty shoot-out to Notts County in the semi-final of the 1993–94 Anglo-Italian Cup, before two consecutive relegations took them back whence they came. </p><p>In 2006–07, again after consecutive promotions, they played one more season in the Championship – the Football League's divisions had been rebranded two years earlier – and produced their best League Cup performance, eliminating Manchester United in the fourth round before losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final via an arguably offside goal scored five minutes from the end of extra time. Southend reached the final of the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams in the lower divisions of the Football League, in both 2004 and 2005. Both finals were played at the Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction, and both ended in defeat by two goals to nil, to Blackpool in 2004 and Wrexham the following year. They repeated the procedure in 2013, albeit this time at the new Wembley, losing 2–0 to Crewe Alexandra and equalling Brentford's record of three final appearances without winning. Financial issues mounted in the 2019–20 season: against a background of non-payment of wages, unpaid taxes, winding-up orders and a transfer embargo meant Southend were unable to avoid relegation to League Two, and even when the tax bill was paid after the sale of the stadium for housing, a 23rd-place finish in 2020–21 meant that Southend United dropped out of the League after 101 years' continuous membership.</p><p>As of the end of the 2020–21 season, the team have spent 26 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 61 in the third, and 7 in the second.

List of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>Wycombe Wanderers Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Founded in 1887 as an amateur club, the team entered the FA Amateur Cup for the first time in 1894–95, made their FA Cup debut the following season, and joined the Southern League in 1896. They played in the Second Division of the Southern League until 1908, when after twice finishing bottom of that league, the club declined the invitation to continue membership and opted for the amateur Great Western Suburban League instead. When competitive football resumed after the First World War they spent two seasons in the Spartan League – winning the title on each occasion – before being accepted into the Isthmian League, in which they spent the remainder of the inter-war period. They finished third in 1930–31, but the highlight of the season was victory in the Amateur Cup. In the final, held at Arsenal's Highbury Stadium, Wycombe beat Hayes 1–0 to win the trophy for the first and only time. The goal was scored by Alf Britnell after 81 minutes. Between 1953–54 and 1959–60, Wycombe never finished outside the top four in the Isthmian League. They won the championship for the first time in 1955–56, retained the title in 1956–57, and reached the Amateur Cup Final that same year. This time, they lost 3–1 in front of a crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium as Bishop Auckland won their third consecutive Amateur Cup.</p><p>At the start of the 1970s, Wycombe won the Isthmian League four times in five seasons. The fourth of those titles, in 1974–75, was in the first season after the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished, so Wycombe made their first appearance in the FA Trophy, which until then had been open to non-League clubs that registered professional players. They also reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time; they held First Division leaders Middlesbrough to a goalless draw at Loakes Park, and only lost the replay to a last-minute goal. Courtesy of the Isthmian League win, they were invited to enter the Anglo-Italian Semi-Professional Trophy, a match played on a home-and-away basis against Monza, winners of the Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti. Wycombe lost the away leg 1–0 but won 2–0 at home to take the trophy.</p><p>Wycombe's continued success in the Isthmian League brought potential promotion to the Alliance Premier League, the level immediately below the Football League. The club twice refused the opportunity before accepting for the 1985–86 season. They finished 20th, and were relegated on goal difference, but thanks to their eighth Isthmian League title, made an immediate return to the higher level, which had been renamed the Football Conference. Under the management of Martin O'Neill, Wycombe won the FA Trophy for the first time in 1991, beating Kidderminster Harriers at Wembley in front of a then record attendance for the competition of 34,842. They followed up with runners-up spot in the 1991–92 season and went one better in 1992–93, adding a second FA Trophy to the Conference title and consequent promotion to the Football League. </p><p>They marked their debut season in the Football League with promotion to the Second Division via the play-offs; after a fourth-place finish, they beat Carlisle United in the semi-final and came from 2–1 down to beat Preston North End 4–2 in the final. After eight seasons in the third tier, they were relegated, and thereafter moved regularly between the two lower tiers. In 2013–14, they avoided a return to the Conference only on goal difference, but bounced back to reach the play-off final the following year, only to lose to Southend United in a penalty shoot-out. In 2017–18, they were promoted back to League One and two years later they reached the second tier of English football for the first time in their history after beating Oxford United 2–1 in the play-off final. Although they lost their first seven matches of the 2020–21 EFL Championship, and were 12 points adrift in mid-February, they recovered to finish 22nd and their relegation was only confirmed on the final day of the season.</p><p>Wycombe reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time in 2000–01; they had not previously passed the third round. They held Liverpool, holders of the 2000–01 League Cup and still in that season's UEFA Cup, for 78 minutes before goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler secured a place in the final for the Premier League club; Keith Ryan made the score 2–1. In the Football League Cup, Wycombe eliminated two Premier League clubs, Fulham and Charlton Athletic, on their way to the 2006–07 semi-final; they drew with Chelsea in the home leg, but lost 4–0 at Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Since their admission to the Football League, Wycombe have spent 13 seasons in the fourth tier of the English football league system, 14 in the third tier, and 1 in the second.

List of Watford F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>Watford Football Club is an English football club from Watford, Hertfordshire. Formed on 15 April 1898 as a result of the amalgamation of two strong local clubs, Watford St. Mary's and West Herts. West Herts began life as Watford Rovers in 1881, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886. In the same year, they also entered the county-wide Herts Senior Cup, reaching the final six times over the next ten years. Watford Rovers became West Herts in 1891, and joined the Southern League for the 1896–97 season. The team started to change from one composed entirely of amateurs to one including paid professionals. In 1898, West Herts amalgamated with Watford St Mary's to form a new club, Watford Football Club.</p><p>The club participated in the Southern League from 1896 until 1920, experiencing considerable success. They won six league titles in this period, including the Southern League First Division in 1914–15. After the resumption of Southern League football following a four-year hiatus due to the First World War, Watford missed out on a second consecutive title in 1919–20 on goal average. They joined the Football League Third Division in the 1920–21 season, and following its subsequent reorganisation became founder members of the Third Division South in 1921.</p><p>Watford competed in the Third Division South for the next 37 years, with little success. Fred Pagnam finished as the Division's top scorer in 1922–23, the club reached the final of the Third Division South Cup in 1935 and 1937 (winning on the latter occasion), and Len Dunderdale scored 21 goals for Watford in 1938–39 despite leaving midway through the season. The team started to progress after the reorganisation of the Football League into four national divisions in 1958. They won promotion to the Third Division in 1960, the Second Division in 1969, and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1970. However, the league progress was reversed with two relegations over the next five years, and in 1976–77 Watford were briefly bottom of the entire Football League.</p><p>A turning point in the club's history came in the late 1970s. Singer, shareholder and lifelong Watford supporter Elton John became chairman in 1976, and appointed Graham Taylor as manager in 1977. The club achieved consecutive promotions between 1977 and 1979, and reached the First Division for the first time in their history in 1982. Furthermore, in 1982–83 Watford finished second in the First Division, and Luther Blissett was the division's top scorer with 27 goals. Consequently, Watford qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1983–84. They also reached their first FA Cup final, losing 2–0 to Everton at Wembley Stadium. Following Taylor's departure in 1987, Watford were relegated in 1988.</p><p>Watford remained in English football's second tier for eight seasons, until they were relegated in 1995–96. Taylor returned as manager in 1997, and for the second time in his career led Watford to consecutive promotions, although he was unable to prevent relegation from the Premier League in 1999–2000. In the 21st century Watford have reached three FA Cup semi-finals, one League Cup semi-final, and spent three further season in the Premier League after winning the 2006 Football League Championship play-off final under the management of Aidy Boothroyd and following automatic promotion under Slaviša Jokanović in 2015.</p>"	consecutive war joined average 1935 pagnam his over this competed leaving elton entirely graham fred 1988watford composed 1982 first season an four returned slaviša wembley club after progress missed he 1914–15 came countywide scored st in watford john led to hertfordshire form 1921watford they midway however resumption 2–0 goal singer 1976 entered luther occasion have professional shareholder little 1979 a time 1960 one on stadium wa blissett third spent team two 1898 next 1919–20 league change tier further boothroyd century six jokanović taylor formed qualified success senior 1970 consequently won aidy late new 1976–77 paid history leaguea final 1881 same considerable 1920 semifinal amalgamation promotion is title furthermore cup hiatus 21 english eight career reversed experiencing manager losing appointed management with football fouryear life clubthe len relegated achieved were south reaching subsequent it became 1987 1886 result until following turning started participated reorganisation supporter premier of local due unable point 15 division their into rover strong including lifelong despite playoff 1922–23 for founder 1983–84 2006 and ten 1896–97 under 1999–2000 from through between 1977 chairman fa uefa 1969 second 37 national 1970s 21st member automatic 1891 out world 1937 period scorer top reached relegation also entire 1997 1938–39 although remained briefly april west latter three 1896 dunderdale 1995–96 mary 2015 amateur herts the winning bottom 27 year departure everton prevent amalgamated championship 1958 1982–83 five began southern at 1920–21 finished	Wikimedia list article	wikimedia article list	Sports_teams
List of Everton F.C. seasons	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p><p>The following lists Everton's League performances, top goalscorers and average attendances from 1888, when the Football League was formed, to the end of the most recent completed season. For a more detailed history see History of Everton F.C. </p><p>Everton were founder members of the Football League in 1888 and were champions of it for the first time in 1891. By the time World War II broke out in 1939, they had been league champions five times and had fielded some of the biggest names in English football, including goalkeeper Ted Sagar and forwards Dixie Dean and Tommy Lawton. In Everton's title-winning season of 1927–28, Dean scored a record 60 league goals in a single season – which has not been matched in this country since. </p><p>Everton originally played at Anfield until a dispute with their landlord in 1892 saw the club exit the ground, which was re-occupied by the newly formed Liverpool, who gradually became Everton's fierce local rivals. Everton, meanwhile, settled into nearby Goodison Park, where they have played ever since, in spite of a series of plans since the late 1990s to relocate the club to a new stadium. </p><p>Everton have played in the top flight of English football for all but four seasons since the 1888 creation of the Football League, playing at the top level continuously since 1954. Only Arsenal have enjoyed a longer unbroken run at the highest level. </p><p>After World War II, Everton's first major success came in 1963, when the league title was won under the management of Harry Catterick, who added another league title to Everton's honours list in 1970 as well as the FA Cup in 1966. </p><p>Another golden era at Everton prevailed after the appointment of Howard Kendall as manager in 1981. Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and were league champions in 1985, when they also won their first European trophy in the shape of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Another league title followed in 1987. </p><p>Everton's only major trophy since 1987 came in 1995 when they won the FA Cup under the management of Joe Royle, who like Kendall had been with the club during his playing career. Since the formation of the FA Premier League in 1992, their highest league finish was fourth place in 2005 and on one occasion (1998) they finished one place above the relegation zone, only avoiding relegation on goal difference. </p><p>The appointment of David Moyes as manager in 2002 brought something of a turning point in Everton's recent history, as the new manager re-established the club as a regular feature in the top few places of the English league, although he failed to add any silverware, the club being finalists in the 2009 FA Cup Final. Moyes departed in 2013 after 11 years as Everton manager to take charge of Manchester United, being succeeded by Roberto Martinez, who had a promising first season but was sacked after three seasons to be replaced by Ronald Koeman. Koeman was dismissed in October 2017, with the club lying in 18th position in the initial stage of the 2017–18 season. Koeman was replaced by Sam Allardyce with the team eventually finishing 8th in the Premier League. Allardyce had his 18-month contract terminated at the end of the season. </p><p>On 31 May 2018, Everton appointed Marco Silva, as their new manager. Silva had originally been approached to become the clubs' manager in October 2017, following the dismissal of Ronald Koeman. However, at that stage he was still manager of Watford and subsequently any proposed deal at that time fell through. Silva was replaced at Watford in January 2018, after a bad run of results in the Premier League.

Moniek Kleinsman	<p><b>Moniek Kleinsman</b> (born 3 November 1982) is a Dutch speed skater who was born in Bentelo, Overijssel, and currently resides in Wolvega. She competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics.</p><p>Kleinsman got her first speed skating lessons at the age of four. A few years later, when she was getting more serious into the sport she was mainly focussing on short track speed skating, just like her brother. However, at the age of twelve she decided to concentrate on long track speed skating instead. </p><p>After competing among the seniors for a few years her breakthrough came in the 2004–05 season, when she won the Dutch national allround championships. That season she appeared on World Cup meets, became 7th at the European allround championships, followed by an eighth position at the World allround championships. Finally, at the KNSB Dutch Single Distance Championships she won two bronze medals over 3000 and 5000 metres. </p><p>On 28 December 2005 Kleinsman qualified herself for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin at the 3000 metres. It was the third time behind Ireen Wüst and Renate Groenewold. A second try to qualify for the race over 5000 metres fails as she became fourth, however she skated a personal best time that day.</p><p>Prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics Kleinsman became under pressure by the Dutch media as it was unsure whether 2002 Winter Olympics silver medalist Gretha Smit could participate at the Olympic 5000 metres race. Smit finished third at the Dutch qualifying competition where only the first and second rider automatically qualified. The third spot had to be won during the Olympic 3000 metres race. To accomplish this three Dutch riders had to finish among the first 16 riders on the distance. Ireen Wüst and Renate Groenewold were expected to do this and indeed reached their goal with Wüst even winning the gold medal. Kleinsman was expected to reach the first 16 as well, but there were some doubts by analysts and the pressure on Kleinsman rose.</p><p>In the end Kleinsman under performed in her race, finishing in 17th position behind Anna Rokita who skated almost a second faster. As a result, Smit was unable to start at the 5000 metres and Kleinsman got under fire by the media again. Her reaction was that she felt sorry for Smit, but that it was not her problem. She did all she could, but was unable to skate faster. She said people should not blame her, if Smit wanted to race in Turin she had to skate faster at the qualifying tournament. Later during the Games she also skated in the pursuit team, where Smit also participated in. Kleinsman was unable to follow the team as soon as the half way mark was passed and the other members had to slow their speed. In the elimination rounds the Dutch faced high favourites Germany and were eliminated.</p><p>Unless her words the pressure remained and she had a hard time during her preparations for the next season. She was unable to get back to her good form she constantly had before the Turin incident and did not qualify for any of the major tournaments in the season like the World Cups, continental and world championships. However, besides her speed skating she still studies nursing in Enschede and therefore was eligible to qualify for the 2007 Winter Universiade, which were also held in Turin.</p><p>Kleinsman succeeded in the qualification program and was determined for another chance in Turin and to close the subject that resulted in her bad period. At the 1500 metres she did well among the top skaters and finished in a third position, which was good for a bronze medal. She also won a silver medal over 5000 metres and a gold in the team pursuit alongside Janneke Ensing and Diane Valkenburg.</p>	2005 doubt eligible spot pursuit medalist over competed this even favourite diane did finishing chance winter 1982 first season like wolvega an kleinsman finish word four short renate after incident only anna still turin just came constantly track janneke silver by smit enschede eighth in 5000 her to be all form however 2007 personal goal mark herself participate follow instead bentelo dayprior before valkenburg try held almost any a time moniek meet on major nursing which wa qualification third close gold groenewold decided team 16 get few two next distance felt where qualified succeeded focussing senior won round fourth later olympics reach is turinkleinsman when elimination cup wanted that game 28 could start again among pressure december qualifying with there therefore dutch bad brother besides rosein 7th were fails slow germany finally became it not continental study determined got during result 2004–05 wüst skating eliminatedunless some participated medium of 17th ireen who olympicskleinsman 1500 hard getting unable metre long way other performed their should program subject into had faster behind reaction qualify speed alongside for analyst lesson competition indeed 2006 end said rider and under people competing if tournament good medal she do passed sorry skated whether appeared november second sport twelve 2002 olympic skate national expected fire 3000 half another european ensing best member back gretha soon single world born resides period unsure top reached allround faced 3 bronze blame also remained overijssel age breakthrough automatically rokita mainly followed more position race three knsb concentrate the winning skater serious problem year resulted championship accomplish preparation well universiade high at but finished currently	Dutch speed skater and politician	skater dutch and politician speed	Sportspeople

Her story has been often repeated and inspired popular misconceptions of the dangers of the tropical rain forest. </p><p>In 1749, her husband, Jean Godin des Odonais, left their home in Riobamba, Ecuador, Spanish South America to visit French Guiana. As a French citizen, he was refused permission by the Spanish and Portuguese authorities to return for his family. Isabel Godin des Odonais became famous for being the only survivor of a 42-person, 3000-mile expedition through the Amazon Basin to rejoin her husband. They were reunited in 1770 and later returned to France together. </p>	riobamba his often him 1792 authority an returned saintamandmontrond viceroyalty jean only he home rain left by unusual odonais in her to they mouth considered colonial repeated a wa isabel 18thcentury family permission famous 20 basin history visit later being forest is spanish france 28 journey been rejoin with return amazon were south ecuador guiana peru became not 1749 danger september until 3000mile citizen of 42person expedition misconception – long 1728 their politics for cher popular and survivor from through inspired portuguese now ha 1770 river america together woman tropical refused french husband separated more reunited than western the story year de who godin	Spanish traveler	traveler spanish	Transport

Conventional valve gear had improved, superseding the former advantages of the Daimler-Knight sleeve-valve technology. The car's name derived from its tax rating of 15 hp.

The Great Depression of the 1930s was well established and Daimler, responsible for economical BSA three-wheelers and, from 1931, the mid-price Lanchester range, went downmarket to assist sales in the austere times. Perhaps it took twenty years but this risky strategy with the Daimler name may have lost Daimler its super-luxury reputation and eventually brought about its demise.</p><p>In August 1934, in anticipation of the reduction in annual tax charge, the Fifteen was given a larger 2-litre engine.

Rail transport in Vietnam	"<p>The <b>railway system in Vietnam</b> is owned and operated by the state-owned Vietnam Railways (Vietnamese: <i lang=""vi"">Đường sắt Việt Nam</i>). The principal route, the single track North-South Railway running between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, accounts for 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi) of the network's total length of 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi). The national railway network uses mainly metre gauge, although there are several standard gauge and mixed gauge lines in the north of the country.</p><p>The first railways in Vietnam were established in the 1880s, with construction beginning in 1888; these included a tram running between the ports of Saigon and Cholon, and a regional rail line connecting Saigon with Mỹ Tho. Railway construction flourished soon afterwards, during the administration of Paul Doumer as Governor-General of French Indochina from 1897 to 1902. It was during this time that construction of the Yunnan–Vietnam and North–South railways began. Construction of the north–south line took over thirty years, finally ending in 1936, during which time other branch lines were also completed. Beginning in World War II, the entire rail network became a target of bombing attacks by a number of groups, including both North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese troops during the Vietnam War. Although the main lines—particularly the North–South line—were quickly restored and returned to service once conflict ended, many branch lines were abandoned and dismantled at their expense, their infrastructure used to replace damaged sections of the main lines, or sold as scrap.</p><p>With increased economic growth brought on by the Doi Moi reforms of the late 1980s, the railway system has entered a renewed phase of development. A number of major projects supported by official development assistance have been proposed or are currently underway, including a series of projects to improve bridge and railway safety on the North-South Railway line, connections to Cambodia and Laos, and the restoration of a number of defunct lines, including the Đà Lạt–Tháp Chàm railway first established in the 1930s. A high-speed rail link between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City has also been proposed, which would reduce journey length from 30 hours to around 6 hours. Laos has held a ceremony but construction remains stalled (2019) on a rail line to Lao Bao from Savannakhet, across from the Thai rail head to Bangkok. Two project for high-speed railway include the North-South Railway Express and the Ho Chi Minh City–Cần Thơ express railway. </p>"	war yunnan–vietnam supported 1072 this over or hanoi line used connection 2019 port around north troop saigon length first system target reform underway 1936 returned indochina route thirty growth rail development track 1930s railway by in abandoned express section to governorgeneral mixed bridge 1902 bao connecting entered đường have across northsouth vietnamese expense these 2600 construction vietnam held a time major which on assistance wa mi ending total 1880s phase line—were two completed tram remains gauge series included both include safety city–cần late increased thơ tho group lạt–tháp regional is operated restored branch that running us bangkok ceremony journey been kilometre sắt many with there established attack main service project highspeed were south restoration number it finally became during head principal quickly of administration lao defunct link cholon owned beginning metre other lines—particularly economic 1600 doumer ended their including damaged dismantled account 1726 scrapwith 30 for 1980s took and official 6 from ii paul between would chi hour countrythe several once brought minh national đà ha stalled doi soon replace single world 1888 nam thai also entire mỹ improve việt although city moi are renewed afterwards french mainly north–south conflict infrastructure sold cambodia 1897 chàm the flourished standard year network proposed began at but reduce bombing savannakhet ho currently stateowned	overview of rail transport in Vietnam	rail overview of in transport vietnam	Transport
Kunming–Singapore railway	<p>The <b>Kunming–Singapore railway</b>, increasingly called the <b>Pan–Asia railway Network</b> is a network of railways that connects China, Singapore and all the countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The concept originated with British and French imperialists, who sought to link the railways they had built in southwest China, Indochina and Malaya, but international conflicts in the 20th century kept regional railways fragmented. The idea was formally revived in October 2006 when 18 Asian and Eurasian countries signed the Trans-Asian railway Network Agreement, which incorporated the Kunming–Singapore railway into the Trans-Asian railway network. </p><p>The network consists of three main routes from Kunming, China to Bangkok, Thailand: the Eastern route via Vietnam and Cambodia; the Central route via Laos, and the Western route via Myanmar. The southern half of the network from Bangkok to Singapore has been operational since 1918. The Central route opened on 3 December 2021, with the opening of the Yuxi–Mohan railway and Boten–Vientiane railway linking with the other operational segments of the route, which formally connected Kunming and Singapore directly by rail. There have been plans for high-speed railway constructions, though only one line (between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima) has since entered the construction phase. </p><p>The railway network is expected to increase regional economic integration and increase China's economic ties with Southeast Asia. </p>	october connected singapore line 20th kept directly indochina only route rail railway agreement southwest by in to all they opened entered have vietnam construction southeast a one which on wa pan–asia mainland phase sought consists 2021 century 18 boten–vientiane kunming–singapore malaya asian regional is when formally that idea bangkok kunming 1918 imperialist been integration china december nakhon with linking there main thailand highspeed eurasian since segment operational eastern increase of lao link via plan originated other increasingly economic into opening had concept for 2006 asia and from myanmar between tie incorporated built half ha expected fragmented ratchasima central 3 connects signed revived international french conflict cambodia british three western the country network called though transasian yuxi–mohan southern who but	railway line	railway line	Transport

Pyynikki Esker	"<p>The <b>Pyynikki Esker</b> (or the <b>Pyynikki Ridge</b>; Finnish: <i lang=""fi"">Pyynikinharju</i>) is the tallest longitudinal esker in the world, located in Pyynikki, Tampere, Finland. The ridge rises to a height of 160 meters above sea level and 80 meters above the surface of Lake Pyhäjärvi. The Pyynikki Esker belongs to the ridge formation that extends from South Ostrobothnia to Salpausselkä. The ridge formation continues west of the Pyynikki Esker as a rocky ridge known as the Pispala Esker (Pispalanharju) and Tahmela. To the east, after the settlement of Tampere, the ridge becomes the Kalevankangas esker, where there has been a cemetery by same name for almost 150 years. In Kangasala, the ridge formation continues as the four ridges called Kirkkoharju, Kuohunharju, Keisarinharju and Vehoniemenharju. The Pyynikki Esker, like longitudinal ridges, is mainly gravel and sand. </p><p>There are still some old European red pines growing in Pyynikki, whose roots are partly in the air, as the sandy ground rolls down towards Lake Pyhäjärvi over the years. Vegetation on gravel ridges has not only pines but also junipers that are protected. However, juniper berries can be picked when you remember that the branches should not be folded or the juniper should not be removed from the ground. There also grows Norway maples, which give the ridge a beautiful color in autumn. Mountain currants also grow on these ridges. In the middle of the heathers you can find golden chanterelles and in the autumn a few other edible mushrooms. Lingonberries also thrive on the southern slopes.</p><p>The Pyynikki observation tower, built in 1929, is still in use. It has a ground-level café.

Westminster Hospital Medical School	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Westminster Hospital Medical School</b> was formally founded in 1834 by George Guthrie, an ex-military surgeon – although students had been taken on at Westminster Hospital almost from the hospital's foundation in 1719 (the traditional name at the Westminster was ""cubs"").</p><p>The hospital and medical school moved to larger buildings several times in the decades that followed, leading to conflict among the staff on several occasions. Guthrie's forceful urgings on retaining the location of the hospital and school on one occasion resulted in an argument climaxing in a pistol duel between two surgeons (though each missed each other).</p><p>One early Westminster student was John Snow, later the founder of modern epidemiology. </p><p>In 1905, the teaching of pre-clinical subjects ended at Westminster, and moved to King's College. The school was taken over by the army in 1914 to train pathologists for the war effort. Student numbers and the school suffered as a result, and it was only after 1920 that numbers improved. </p><p>In 1984, Westminster Hospital Medical School merged with local rivals Charing Cross Hospital Medical School to form Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School. This move was part of a general series of mergers in the London medical schools in the early 1980s. Westminster Hospital moved to the site of St Stephen's Hospital on Fulham Road in Chelsea in 1993, and changed its name to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. In 1997, CXWMS merged with the National Heart and Lung Institute at the Royal Brompton Hospital, and Imperial College London, whose medical department was St Mary's Hospital Medical School.

Coat of arms of Imperial College London	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>coat of arms of Imperial College London</b> is an heraldic emblem used by Imperial College London. Edward VII granted the college the arms on the 6 June 1908 by royal warrant.

The historic constituent colleges, and their surviving constituent unions use their own emblems, with only the City and Guilds's emblem being a coat of arms. Many of the historic medical schools which merged to form Imperial College School of Medicine also had their own coat of arms, although these are no longer used. On 5 June 2020, the college decided to remove the motto from the official rendition of the coat of arms, to address issues of colonialism. This was part of a wider effort to address racial inequality in college provisions following the murder of George Floyd and the ensuing focus on the Black Lives Matter movement. The motto, ""<span title=""Latin-language text""><i lang=""la"">Scientia imperii decus et tutamen</i></span>"", which is translated as ""<i>Scientific knowledge, the crowning glory and the safeguard of the empire</i>"", had always traditionally been shown with the crest, being depicted as such by Fox-Davies as early as 1915.

Universities Tests Act 1871	"<p class=""mw-empty-elt""> </p> <p>The <b>Universities Tests Act 1871</b> was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It abolished religious ""Tests"" and allowed Roman Catholics, non-conformists and non-Christians to take up professorships, fellowships, studentships and other lay offices at the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham. It also forbade religious tests for ""any degree (other than a degree in divinity)"". </p><p>The Act built upon earlier acts that had limited religious tests in the universities concerned. The Oxford University Act 1854 had abolished tests for the degree of BA, but not for higher degrees. The Cambridge University Act 1856 abolished tests for all degrees in Arts, Law, Music and Medicine, but stated that the degree would not enable the holder to become a member of senate or hold ""any Office … which has been heretofore always held by a Member of the United Church of <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>"" unless they made a declaration that they were ""<i>bona fide</i> a Member of the Church of <i>England</i>"" (the latter provisions were abolished by the 1871 Act). The Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral (the governing body of Durham University at that time) changed the university's regulations in 1865 to remove religious tests on degrees (except in theology).</p><p>Passed during the course of William Ewart Gladstone's first ministry, the act was to obtain support from the non-conformists since these were a major support group for the Liberal Party.</p><p>The direct instigation for this legislation was the widely publicised case of Numa Edward Hartog, the first Jewish Senior Wrangler in the history of Cambridge University, who could not accept the fellowship that would otherwise routinely be offered, because he could not subscribe to the required test on account of his religion. His testimony before the House of Lords helped secure passage of the bill, after the Lords had twice blocked similar legislation in 1869 and 1870.</p><p>Numa Hartog would have been the first Jew after the passing of this act to be elected a fellow at the University of Cambridge, but he died of smallpox. The first Jew to be elected a fellow was Samuel Alexander at Lincoln College, University of Oxford in 1882.</p>"	holder ireland house case his cathedral higher or this alexander died blocked first except an changed smallpox subscribe after lincoln united he religion 1869 fellow gladstone fellowship by in to earlier all be samuel they hartog 1882 passage passing nonchristians have provision testimony dean obtain university before legislation these hold held religious allowed any a time major cambridge which on liberal wa england william upon college up because 1865 test senior always history roman group law stated office … that ministry partythe 1871 studentship could declaration required limited been course forbade 1854 ewart durham edward oxford kingdom nonconformist widely divinity degree were unless since it not governing during jew professorship of otherwise who twice lord enable other lay wrangler bona jewish had concerned account catholic offered abolished fide secure for body and remove from publicised regulation would accept direct built theologypassed art numa ha medicine chapter member routinely take music made helped 1856 act also senate support latter similar than elected ba the become 1870numa instigation church parliament at but bill heretofore	1871 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Act of Parliament 34 & 35 Vic c. 26	ireland kingdom 26 and of parliament 34 35 vic act great britain c 1871 united	Universities_and_colleges

Steamboat ladies	"<p> ""<b>Steamboat ladies</b>"" was a nickname given to a number of female students at the women's colleges of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge who were awarded <i>ad eundem</i> University of Dublin degrees at Trinity College Dublin, between 1904 and 1907, at a time when their own universities refused to confer degrees upon women. The name comes from the means of transport commonly used by these women to travel to Dublin for this purpose.</p><p>Trinity admitted female students in 1904. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge, where women had for some years been admitted to separate female colleges within the overall university, both men and women were admitted to the University of Dublin's only college (Trinity) and it was felt there would be no rationale to restrict successful female students from graduating to become members of the university like their male counterparts. In accordance with the long-standing formula of <i>ad eundem</i> mutual recognition that existed between Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge, Anthony Traill, the then-Provost of Trinity College, proposed that eligible female Oxbridge course completers be granted Trinity degrees, as was the case for men. The policy lasted from June 1904 to December 1907, when requirements for <i>ad eundem</i> awards were revised.</p><p>The Board of Trinity College thought that only small numbers of women would take up the offer to graduate and that they would be Irish women who had studied in Oxford or Cambridge colleges. In fact, by 1907 Trinity had granted degrees to some 720 ""steamboat ladies"".<sup>[3]</sup> All had passed examinations at Oxbridge that would have earned them a degree if they were male.<sup>[3]</sup> The women were predominantly students of Girton and Newnham Colleges, Cambridge and Somerville College, Oxford.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>Money derived from the degree conferral fees that female graduates paid during this period was largely ring-fenced and was used to fund the purchase of Trinity Hall, an extramural hall of residence for female students, which opened in 1908. </p>"	come formula eligible case policy this or used confer like existed graduate newnham conferral an steamboat only fee thenprovost at trinity by irish in to purposetrinity admitted be all they opened oxbridge fact have men university lasted examination these rationale a time cambridge mean student college wa which them upon ladies3 transport dublin up 720 successful felt where studied 1904 both paid fund granted ringfenced restrict extramural 1907 when 1908 that earned male travel been girton residence course completers derived name december commonly with given there predominantly oxford degree were male3 june number it mutual anthony during female some of own thought hall recognition award their counterpart had oxford2money offer lady traill for and if from revisedthe passed between would awarded somerville graduating within member take period largely separate requirement woman small refused ad no accordance eundem board nickname unlike the become year proposed purchase overall who longstanding	British women getting degrees from Trinity College Dublin (1904-1907)	woman degree trinity college british from dublin getting 19041907	Universities_and_colleges

Widening participation	<p> <b>Widening participation</b> (<b>WP</b>) in higher education is a major component of government education policy in the United Kingdom and Europe. It consists of an attempt to increase not only the numbers of young people entering higher education, but also the proportion from under-represented groups (those from lower income families, people with disabilities and some ethnic minorities). </p><p>In this way it is hoped to redress the inequalities in participation between social classes. Widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the Office for Students (OfS). The issue of widening participation became a political issue after the Laura Spence Affair which hit the headlines in 2000, and after the University of Bristol admissions controversy in 2003, which concerned alleged biases in favour of the state sector. </p><p>The Office for Students is pursuing this policy through a number of measures, including the payment of financial incentives to universities and by funding the Uni Connect programme. </p><p>This policy is linked to the previous Labour government's target of increasing participation in higher education to 50% by 2010. </p>	strategic 2010 policy this higher an target after only class united entering 2003 connect objective by in to education university bristol a increasing major one which student ofs young minority funding income ethnic consists family underrepresented hit 2000 government state group pursuing uni is bias attempt office affair labour alleged with issue linked kingdom spence number it not became programme favour component some increase political controversy of headline previous 50 financial way wp disability including proportion concerned laura for hoped and those people from through between incentive inequality lower admission europe measure also participation widening redress the sector payment but social	efforts to broaden access to higher education	access broaden higher to effort education	Universities_and_colleges

Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom	"<p> <b>Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom</b> can be divided into two broad categories: those in federal universities such as the University of London, which are primarily teaching institutions joined in a federation, and residential colleges in universities following (to a greater or lesser extent) the traditional collegiate pattern of Oxford and Cambridge, which may have academic responsibilities but are primarily residential and social. The legal status of colleges varies widely, both with regard to their corporate status and their status as educational bodies. London colleges are all considered 'recognised bodies' with the power to confer University of London degrees and, in many cases, their own degrees. Colleges of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) are 'listed bodies', as ""bodies that appear to the Secretary of State to be constituent colleges, schools, halls or other institutions of a university"". Colleges of the plate glass universities of Kent, Lancaster and York, along with those of the University of Roehampton and the University of the Arts London do not have this legal recognition. Colleges of Oxford (with three exceptions), Cambridge, London, and UHI, and the ""recognised colleges"" and ""licensed halls"" of Durham, are separate corporations, while the colleges of other universities, the ""maintained colleges"" of Durham, and the ""societies of the university"" at Oxford are parts of their parent universities and do not have independent corporate existence. </p><p>In the past, many of what are now British universities with their own degree-awarding powers were colleges which had their degrees awarded by either a federal university (such as Cardiff University) or validated by another university (for example many of the post-1992 universities). Colleges that had (or have) courses validated by a university are not normally considered to be colleges of that university; similarly the redbrick universities that, as university colleges, prepared students for University of London External Degrees were not considered colleges of that university. Some universities (e.g. Cardiff University) refer to their academic faculties as ""colleges"", such purely academic subdivisions are not within the scope of this article. </p>"	highland licensed roehampton appear joined york case existence this or confer listed plate corporation united similarly society by purely exception in while be to all may institution regard power divided example have considered university past recognised a varies which cambridge student college collegiate pattern two article both state parent glass refer that lesser residential such post1992 legal eg faculty secretary many course what durham with oxford kingdom widely degree can part were subdivision external not corporate maintained extent following some teaching school of island independent own hall recognition other category federation their into had broad uhi body for validated and scope those either greater academic do educational degreeawarding constituent awarded now within prepared art another kent cardiff london traditional separate responsibility are british status three the lancaster along normally primarily redbrick federal at but social	some universities in the United Kingdom are composed of colleges	kingdom are composed the some college of in university united	Universities_and_colleges
